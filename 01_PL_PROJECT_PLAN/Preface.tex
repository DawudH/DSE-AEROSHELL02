Dear Reader,

This Project Plan (PP) describes the process and results of the planning phase of the project to design an inflatable guidable aeroshell suitable for manned space flight. This project follows in the wake of a number of investigations performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the viability of such a vehicle for entry and re-entry of atmospheres. Key driver for a new solution to (re-)entry using heat shield is a reduction of mass as compared to conventional solutions, greatly benefiting launch costs for missions to explore and inhabit extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars.
