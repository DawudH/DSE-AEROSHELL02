\section*{Preface}\label{cha:preface}

Dear reader,	


This Project Plan (PP) describes the process and results of the planning phase of the project to design an inflatable guidable aeroshell suitable for manned space flight. This project follows in the wake of a number of investigations performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the viability of such a vehicle for entry and re-entry of atmospheres. Key driver for a new solution to (re-)entry using heat shield is a reduction of mass as compared to conventional solutions, greatly benefiting launch costs for missions to explore and habitate extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars. 

We would like to thank tutor Dr. Ir. Herman Damveld and coaches Dennis Dolkens and Niels Reuring for their support and guidance in this project. In addition, we are thankful for the facilities and services provided by Delft University of Technology and the Ontwerp Synthese Coordinatie Commissie and Student Assistants.
