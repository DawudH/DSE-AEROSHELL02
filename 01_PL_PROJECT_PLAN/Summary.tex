Conclusions and recommendations

One of the solutions that fulfill the need to carry human payload to Mars is a controllable inflatable aeroshell (CIA). The project has to demonstrate the feasability of such a controllable inflatable aeroshell. The design of this product can be considered as complex. Therefore Systems Engineering (SE) methods and tools can be used to simplify the design process. The initial steps are the organization of the group as a team and subsequently organizing the project work itself. These steps are summarized in this Project Plan.

The first SE-tool that has been used is the Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) aiming to divide the project team in tasks, functions and responbilities. Examples of divisions are the chairman, seceretary and systems engineer. This is then followed by assigning different team members to different tasks. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is utilized to identify the required activities during the project. Here the project work is divided into phases to achieve a high-level division of the work. Where the WBS identifies the required activities, the Work Flow Diagram (WFD) will indicate the sequence of these activities. This diagram shows the logic flow
