\section*{Summary}\label{cha:summary}%Notes: Stand alone, consise and do not explain anything.
Ever since successful manned missions to the moon, then next step is a manned mission to mars. Entry in the atmosphere of mars induces great aerodynamic loads which lead to high thermal and structural loads on the structure. Where a spacecraft structure can be designed for very high loads, the human body is limited in the loads it can endure. This creates the need for a system that can perform an entry on mars while keeping loads within the limits of what the human body can endure. A very promising design to perform such an entry is an inflatable guidable entry vehicle using a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (HIAD). Three designs have been made and tested on earth by NASA and the next will be launched in 2016. \cite{irve,irve2,irve3,thor} These designs show the feaseblility of using this method to do a re-entry. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a controllable inflatable re-entry vehicle for hypersonic guided Mars entry of human class spacecraft using available launchers with nine persons in ten weeks time.
