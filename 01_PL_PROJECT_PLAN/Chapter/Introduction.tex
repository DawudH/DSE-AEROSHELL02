\section{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}
The design of a controllable inflatable aeroshell can be considered as a complex problem. To reduce the complexity of the design problem Systems Engineering methods and tools can be used to succesfully develop the complex system. One of the important aspects in the development of this complex system is project management. The first steps in the project management process are summarized in this Project Plan.

The purpose of the Project Plan is to outline the general approach of the group to the technical and management aspects of the design project. The Plan shall show how the group plans to accomplish all necessary tasks to prepare the design. This is done by using structures to break down the organization and work. Also the logic order of the work flow and their deadlines are stated.

The structure of this report is as follows. In Chapter 2 the mission is described and the top-level requirements are given. The Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS) is shown in Chapter 3. The next Chapter depicts the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The planning of the project is done by means of a Gantt chart in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 explains the logic flow of the planned work using a work flow diagram. In the following chapter a general approach to the sustainable development of the mission is briefly explained. The report is then concluded in Chapter 8.
