\section{Work Breakdown Structure}\label{cha:WBS}
Project work has been divided into a number of phases: project planning, literature research, mission analysis, tool development and enhancement, conceptual design of a first set of concepts, detailed design of a number of selected concepts and project close-out. This high-level work division is summarized in the work breakdown structure (WBS) displayed in Figure \ref{fig:wbs}. Whereas the sequence of activities is illustrated by the Work Flow Diagram (WFD), the WBS provides a categorization of activities. 

A number of project phases is distinguished with clearly identifiable milestones that close activities. Predominantly, these milestones are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Project Plan (PP):] Finalizes provisional planning of the project, comprising: technical and managerial function appointment to team members, allocation of resources, break-down and sequencing of project work, formulation of a risk management plan and a plan for sustainable development, set-up of archiving, doucmentation and logbook and consolidating a set of project procedures.
\item[Baseline Review (BR):] Finalizes the mission analysis phase by a liaison with the customer for agreement on mission definition, requirements and planning as well as a presentation of initial concepts formulated in the conceptual design phase.
\item[Mid-Term Review (MTR):] Finalizes the first phase of concept selection, reviewing the concepts for trade-off, the trade-off process and resulting final concepts for further evaluation.
\item[Final Review (FR):] xxx
