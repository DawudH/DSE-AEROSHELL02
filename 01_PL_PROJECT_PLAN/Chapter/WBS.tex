\section{Work Breakdown Structure}\label{cha:WBS}
Project work has been divided into a number of phases: project planning, literature research, mission analysis, tool development and enhancement, conceptual design of a first set of concepts, detailed design of a number of selected concepts and project close-out. This high-level work division is summarized in the work breakdown structure (WBS) displayed in Figure \ref{fig:wbs}. 

Whereas the sequence of activities is illustrated by the Work Flow Diagram (WFD), the WBS provides a categorization of activities. As such, a number of project phases is distinguished with clearly identifiable milestones that close activities. Predominantly, these milestones are the following:
