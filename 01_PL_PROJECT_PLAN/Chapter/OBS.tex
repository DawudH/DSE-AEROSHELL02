\section{Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS)}\label{cha:OBS}
In this chapter the organisational breakdown structure is illustrated and explained. The breakdown can be considered as two separate parts. The first is the management breakdown, which shows the responsibilities of the various roles and is discussed in the first section. The second section deals with the engineering breakdown. Given in Figure \ref{fig:OBS} is the OBS, where every position will be explained in more detail in sections \ref{subsec:management} and \ref{subsec:engineer}.

\subsection{Management breakdown}\label{subsec:management}
% Organisational Breakdown Structure (organogram with the responsibilities of the various group members)
The size of the project group, with nine people, is too large to be self-organizing: if no organizational structure is apparent, people will not have a clear view of the required work, leading to inefficient time-management. Therefore the organization is broken down into different positions with corresponding responsibilities. All positions do not entail exclusive contribution of the appointed functions, but indicate where final responsibility lies for each aspect. Therefore team members assist and communicate with one another between different management functions.

\subsection{Engineering breakdown}\label{subsec:engineer}
The engineering work of the controllable inflatable aeroshell is divided into different departments. These departments are the driving fields in the design of an inflatable aeroshell and will cover all aspects of the design. As for the management positions, engineering departments are not isolated in the sense that the aim is to involve team members in multiple design aspects.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamics department}\label{subsec:aero}
The aerodynamics department will look at different shapes possible to do the entry in the Martian atmosphere. This department looks at the hypersonic aerodynamics and determine the amount of thermal energy the heat shield needs to absorb and the loads that the structure needs to endure. One of the other aspects will the creation of a aerodynamic model of the vehicle that will be used in the control system.

\subsubsection{Structures department}\label{subsec:struct}
The structures department is responsible for the design of the structure, carrying primarily the mechanical and thermal loads by aerodynamic forces and heating. This design entails appropriate material selection, design and sizing of load-carrying elements and integrating the design while maintaining feasibility in terms of manufacturability, costs and weight. For the purpose of determining structural performance, the structures department is responsible for the development of structural tools. Moreover, the structures department actively communicates with other departments to synthesize the system design.

\subsubsection{Control systems department}\label{subsec:control}
The control systems department will analyse the controllability and stability (C \& S), both static and dynamic, of the vehicle. Further this department will design the subsystems that will provide the needed characteristics for the C \& S. The department covers all additional subsystems to ensure the C \& S system to be fully functional, i.e. an attitude determination system.


\subsubsection{Thermal control department}\label{subsec:therm}
The thermodynamics department will look at the thermal aspect of the inflatable aeroshell. The aerodynamics department will provide a boundary condition for the heat propegation within the structure. This heat propegation will be dependent on the material properties and structure shape as defined by the structures department. Furthermore, the spacevehicle should have a thermal control such that systems can operate and humans can survive.
