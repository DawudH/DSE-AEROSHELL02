\section{Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS)}\label{cha:OBS}
In this chapter the organisational breakdown structure is illustrated and explained. The breakdown can be considered to be in two separate parts. The first is the management breakdown, which shows the responsibilities of the various roles and is discussed in the first section. The second section deals with the engineering breakdown. Given in Figure \ref{fig:OBS} is the OBS, where every position will be explained in more detail in sections \ref{subsec:management} and \ref{subsec:engineer}.

\subsection{Management breakdown}\label{subsec:management}
% Organisational Breakdown Structure (organogram with the responsibilities of the various group members)
The size of the DSE project group, with 9 people, is too large to be self-organizing: if no organizational structure is apparent, people will not have a clear view of the required work, leading to inefficient time-management. Therefore the organization is broken down into different positions with corresponding responsibilities.

\subsection{Engineering breakdown}\label{subsec:engineer}
The engineering work of the controllable inflatable aeroshell is divided into different departments. These departments are the driving fields in the design of an inflatable aeroshell and will cover all aspects of the design.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamics department}\label{subsec:aero}
The aerodynamics department will look at different shapes possible to do the entry in the Martian atmosphere. This department looks at the hypersonic aerodynamics and determine the amount of thermal energy the heat shield needs to absorb and the loads that the structure needs to endure. One of the other aspects will the creation of a aerodynamic model of the vehicle that will be used in the control system.

\subsubsection{Structures department}\label{subsec:struct}
%The structural department is responsible for the design of the structure, such that the aeroshell system is able to withstand both thermal and pressure loads, while %adhering to sizing constraints. As such, it encompasses material choice and sizing and design of the structure. In addition, the structure should be feasible

\subsubsection{Control systems department}\label{subsec:control}
The control systems department will analyse the controllability and stability (C \& S), both static and dynamic, of the vehicle. Further this department will design the subsystems that will provide the needed characteristics for the C \& S. The department covers all additional subsystems to ensure the C \& S system to be fully functional, i.e. an attitude determination system.


\subsubsection{Thermal control department}\label{subsec:therm}
The thermodynamics department will look at the thermal aspect of the inflatable aeroshell. The aerodynamics department will provide a boundary condition for the heat propegation within the structure. This heat propegation will be dependent on the material properties and structure shape as defined by the structures department. Furthermore, the spacevehicle should have a thermal control such that systems can operate and humans can survive.
