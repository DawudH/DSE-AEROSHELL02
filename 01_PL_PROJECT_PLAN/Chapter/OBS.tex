\section{Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS)}\label{cha:OBS}
In this chapter the organisational breakdown structure is illustrated and explained. The breakdown can be considered to be in two separate parts. The first is the management breakdown, which shows the responsibilities of the various roles and is discussed in the first section. The second section deals with the engineering breakdown. Given in Figure \ref{fig:OBS} is the OBS, where every position will be explained in more detail in sections \ref{subsec:management} and \ref{subsec:engineer}.

The size of the DSE project group, with 9 people, is too large to be self-organizing: if no organizational structure is apparent, people will not have a clear view of the required work, leading to inefficient time-management. Therefore the organization is broken down into different positions with corresponding responsibilities.
