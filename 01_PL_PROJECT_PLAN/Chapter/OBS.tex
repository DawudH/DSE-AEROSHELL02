\section{Organisational Breakdown Structure (OBS)}\label{cha:OBS}
% Organisational Breakdown Structure (organogram with the responsibilities of the various group members)
The size of the DSE project group, with 9 people, is too large to be self-organizing: if no organizational structure is apparent, people will not have a clear view of the required work, leading to inefficient time-management. Therefore the organization is broken down into different positions with corresponding responsibilities. Given in figure \ref{fig:OBS} is the OBS, every position will be explained in more detail in sections \ref{subsec:Chairman} till \ref{subsec:QA}.
