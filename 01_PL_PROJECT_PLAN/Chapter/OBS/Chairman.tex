The role of the chairman is to prepare team meetings and guide them such that the meeting itself is performed in an efficient manner, but also the goal of the meeting is achieved: at the end of the meeting, all team members should have a clear overview of the current status of the project, as well as their present responsibilities. It is the task of the chairman to guide meetings such that this information is conveyed between the team members including the members responsible for planning, documentation, and the system engineer. Concretely, this also encompasses making the agenda.
