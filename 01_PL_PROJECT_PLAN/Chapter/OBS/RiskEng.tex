To mitigate cost or time overruns or even worse, eventual product failure, risk management plays a central role within project management. In order to properly address the risks involved in developing an inflatable aeroshell one person is ultimately responsible for possible hazard management: The risk engineer. The task of this risk engineer is to manage the various risks encountered during the design process. This will be done by using technical budgetting to manage the performance risks during the various design phases. Performance margins can be defined for each system and subsystem that influence the performances of other systems. In addition to this risk mapping will be used. By identifying critical components of each proposed concept and allocating the available resources accordingly the project risks can be minimized. Risk management is a continuous process.
