One of the tasks of the documentation manager is to maintain a structure in the file system used on the computer (i.e. keeping Dropbox and Github organized). The documentation manager is also the person to set up the initial files (like the LaTeX templates) and folder structures. The documentation manager should provide basic rules for the layout of the documents, communication with the editor is needed when the layout does not conform these rules. It is needed that this structure is maintained throughout the project and group members should make an effort to keep it this way, if not it is the documentation manager that will point out these problems towards the group and come with possible solutions.
