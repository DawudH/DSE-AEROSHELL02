\paragraph{Validation}
IEEE defines validation as ''The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers.''(ref. ''IEEE V\&V.pdf'') The person in charge of validation is thus responsible for the compliance of the product with the requirements imposed by the costumers and stakeholders.
