\paragraph{Editor}
Primary function is assuring consistent and high quality of all written communication, by means of proof-reading and correcting of pieces submitted by all group members. In addition, the lay-out and structure of reports and presentations is scrutinized and egalized. Strong interaction takes place with all group members with direct contributions to the written work, while open communication with documentation manager is maintained to resolve issues with the formatting of reports. In case of repeated errors by group members, the editor makes an effort to enter conversation with the repeaters in order to identify the origin of the problem and if need be to take pre-emptive action against future occurrences.
\paragraph{Verification}
Verification occurs at multiple stages of the design. For one, concepts should be verified to check whether the developed product meets the requirements. The team member in charge of verification ensures all verification steps are performed in the design process and assesses their outcome.

\paragraph{Validation}
\gls{ieee} defines validation as "The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers." \cite[p.452]{IEEE}. The person in charge of validation is thus responsible for the compliance of the product with the needs of the costumers and stakeholders.
