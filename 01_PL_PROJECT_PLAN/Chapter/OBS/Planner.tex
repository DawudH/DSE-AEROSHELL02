The planner provides an overview for all the work packages over time in the form of a Gantt chart. It is the function of the planner to frequently update and provide more detail to this chart throughout the progress of the project. Furthermore the planner is required to communicate all deadlines to the group members and ensure they are met. Interactions between different tasks are provided and planning is made accordingly to allow all tasks to be finished before the set deadlines or milestones. Progression is recorded throughout the process to ascertain that all deadlines are met.
