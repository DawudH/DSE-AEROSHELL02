The planner provides an overview for all the work packages over time in the form of a Gantt chart. It is the function of the planner to frequently update and provide more detail to this chart throughout the progress of the project. Furthermore the planner is required to communicate all deadlines to the group members and ensure they are met. Interactions between different tasks are provided and planning is made accordingly to allow all tasks to be finished before the set deadlines or milestones. Progression is recorded daily throughout the process to ascertain that all deadlines are met. If the planner notices that task are overrunning their scheduled time multiple corrective actions can be considered. The corrective actions considered depend on the magnitude and severity of overrunning of the planning. If contingency time is available and only small deviations from schedule are considered no corrective action may in some times be taken. The available contingency time can in this case be partly be allocated. Corrective actions considered can be overworking in case the work package is of crucial importance and the required amount of overwork is small. If overwork is not feasible, reducing the complexity of the work package by for example additional simplifying assumptions may need to be considered. The actions taken are discussed within the group and again strongly dependent on the magnitude and severity of the work package.
