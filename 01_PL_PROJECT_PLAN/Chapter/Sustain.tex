\section{Approach with respect to sustainable development}\label{cha:sustain}
Sustainable development in engineering means that the design, production, operation and disposal of a product should be done in a sustainable way. In this case sustainable means that energy and resources are used in a manner that does not threaten the environment or the needs of future generations. In this chapter the general approach with respect to the sustainable development of the controllable inflatable aeroshell is briefly discussed.

Even though sustainability is becoming more important in engineering, it is of less importance in these kind of space missions. The reason for this is that the proposed mission is a single mission and therefore its total impact will be relatively small. For example, it is acceptable that the production of the space vehicle is less sustainable than the production of one small passenger aircraft, since the the aircraft is produced in large numbers where only one space vehicle is produced. It can therefore be said that sustainability will not be a design driver for the controllable inflatable aeroshell. Of course, sustainable methods are preferred when they do not add much costs

1-of-mission, impact small
not the design-driver
