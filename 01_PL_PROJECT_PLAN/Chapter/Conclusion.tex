\section{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}
The general approach of the group to the technical and management aspects of the design project is described in this Project Plan. Both the Organisational and Work Breakdown Structure have been made. A gantt chart and work flow diagram are used to indicate the project phasing, planning, activity flow, deadlines and milestones.

Future work shall start with a literature study to get more familiar with the subject. Other Systems Engineering methods and tools such as a Functional Flow (Block) Diagram, a Functional Breakdown, a Requirements Discovery Tree, a Budget Breakdown, Technical risk assessment and a Design Option Tree can be used to generate five conceptual design. Following this, relatively simple trade-offs can be made. Then using these trade-offs the choice for two conceptual designs can be justified, which will be developed on a more detailed level. Less simple trade-offs between these two preliminary design can be made. This can then justify the choice for one design that will be the final product of this design project.
