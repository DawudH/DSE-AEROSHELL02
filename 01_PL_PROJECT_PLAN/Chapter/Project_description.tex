\section{Project description}\label{cha:project_description}%Notes: Stand alone, consise and do not explain anything.
This section details the present project, stating in Subsection \ref{subsec:systemdescription} a brief introduction into the mission and a historical perspective, while the top-level system requirements are stated in Subsection \ref{subsec:systemrequirements}.

\subsection{System description} 
\label{subsec:systemdescription}
Ever since successful manned missions to the moon, then next step is a manned mission to mars. Entry in the atmosphere of mars induces great aerodynamic loads which lead to high thermal and structural loads on the structure. Where a spacecraft structure can be designed for very high loads, the human body is limited in the loads it can endure. This creates the need for a system that can perform an entry on mars while keeping loads within the limits of what the human body can endure. A very promising design to perform such an entry is an inflatable guidable entry vehicle using a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (HIAD).

Previous missions comparable to the present mission have been performed by NASA, demonstrating the controllability of an inflatable aeroshell, as early as the 1960's. Multiple concepts were developed: a chute that is held under tension with a pressurized toroid that was attached to the structure in one case and trailed the spacecraft using a tow in the other case. These concepts were developed to allow re-entry on Earth and Mars, but were discontinued when problems arised during deployment and contemporary parachute technology proved sufficient for the design goals back then. \citep{hiadhistory}
A pressurized cone containing multiple toroids is another option, one that receives considerable attention from NASA, in the form of three missions performed in the last six years. A fourth mission is planned in 2016. Every next mission shows another aspect with respect to feasibility, controllability and ability to control the maximum deceleration achieved during re-entry. A comparison of key design parameters of these missions can be found in Table \ref{tab:hiadcomparison}.
These tests are now in the spotlight since interplanetary missions involving humans are on the program, with the NASA planning to have humans on Mars by 2030. Since transporting humans puts constraints on maximum deceleration, the present project may provide means to decelerate the interplanetary spacecraft with lower accelerations while still being a light-weight solution.

% Three designs have been made and tested on earth by NASA and the next will be launched in 2016. \cite{irve,irve2,irve3,thor} These designs show the feasibility of using this method to do a re-entry. 
The objective of this project is thus to demonstrate the feasibility of a controllable inflatable re-entry vehicle for hypersonic guided Mars entry of human class spacecraft using available launchers with nine persons in ten weeks time.
