\section{Control system mass estimation}
\label{sec:controlmass}
Using the results produced by the aerodynamic tool shown in section \ref{subsec:appaeroanal} the relative masses of the control systems for each proposed structural concept can be determined. Section \ref{subsec:controlmoments} will derive the magnitudes of the control system moments, after which these will be used in section \ref{subsec:controlmassest} to estimate the relative masses of the control systems required by each respective system-level concept.

\subsection{Required control system moments}
\label{subsec:controlmoments}
In section \ref{subsec:appaeroanal} figure \ref{fig:cm} the \glspl{sym:cma}} required for each concept are shown for a range of angles of attack (\gls{sym:alpha}). As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:cl} the \glspl{sym:CL} delivered by the various concepts are different at all angles of attack. However, the astrodynamics tool described in chapter \ref{ch:astrotool} uses \glspl{sym:CL} to control the orbit of the spacecraft. Since \gls{sym:CM} and \gls{sym:CL} both vary with angle of attack \gls{sym:alpha} the angles of attack required for the correct orbits will vary for each concept. To adjust for these variations the ratio $\frac{\gls{sym:CL}}{\gls{sym:CM}}$ is used to estimate the control system masses for each concept relative to one another. Figure \ref{fig:cmcl} shows this ratio for all considered concepts.
