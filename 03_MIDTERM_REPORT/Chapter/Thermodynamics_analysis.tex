\section{Thermal mass estimation}
\label{ch:thermtool}
Decelerating an entry vehicle requires a thermal protection system. This system will contribute to a large extend to the mass of the entire vehicle. Therefore, a thermal protection system (\gls{tps}) has a critical impact on the mission an should be selected properly. This section will analyse the \gls{tps} of the five trade-off concepts with the use of a thermal protection tool. First the tool will be described in more detail. Afterwards it is described how the tool is verified and validated. In the third section, this tool will be used to analyse different lay-ups for the concepts under anlysis. As a result,the \gls{tps} masses for differnt concepts can be determined. Lastly, concluions and recomendations will be given for possible con
