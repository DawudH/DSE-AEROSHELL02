%\subsection{Performance of control systems}
% \label{sec:astroref}
%Several options for the control system are considered. Using first-order calculations the effectiveness of each control system design option will be assessed. In this context 'effectiveness' is defined as a combination of system mass, moment that can be caused by the system and whether a control output can be sustained for long periods of time. These three criteria will be considered for all three control system design options. The design options to be considered are:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Shifting the \acrfull{cg}
%	\item A \acrfull{rcs}
%	\item Control surfaces (body flaps)
%\end{itemize}
%Each of these options will be quickly assessed in the subsequent sections. This will be done by taking angle of attack \gls{sym:alpha}$=30\deg$. This corresponds to $\gls{sym:CM}\gls{sym:A}=-100$, $\gls{sym:CL}\gls{sym:A}=-58.8$ and $\gls{sym:CD}\gls{sym:A}=126$. These values have been obtained by using the aerodynamical tool described in chapter \ref{ch:aero_analysis} for an Apollo-shaped object. Using equation \ref{eq:moment_from_cm} the control moment required can be obtained.
%\begin{equation}
%M=\frac{1}{2}\gls{sym:rho}\gls{sym:V}^{2}\gls{sym:CM}\gls{sym:A}
%\label{eq:moment_from_cm}
%\end{equation}
%This moment has to be counteracted during a time $t$. Furthermore, for the \gls{rcs} and body flaps the required force can be directly determined by noting that $M=dF$, where $d$ is the moment arm and $F$ is the control force. 
%
%\subsubsection{\gls{cg}-shifting}
%By moving the \acrlong{cg} of the spacecraft the sum of the moments exerted on it changes. This will cause a change in spacecraft attitude, thereby also trimming the capsule. The \gls{cg}-shift can be achieved by shifting the location of the aeroshell with respect to the capsule. This will slightly move the \acrlong{cg} of the spacecraft and change the location of the lift and drag forces acting on it. In order to avoid over-designing the actuator concerned with shifting the aeroshell with respect to the capsule (and thus making it heavier) the movement speeds are limited to low values.
%
%\subsubsection{\acrlong{rcs}}
%By using the control force requirement the mass flow of the \acrlong{rcs} can be determined with equation \ref{eq:rcsmassflow} \cite{Allen2012}.
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{M}{d}=F=\gls{sym:mdot}\gls{sym:Isp}\gls{sym:ge}
%\label{eq:rcsmassflow}
%\end{equation}
%From equation \ref{eq:rcsmassflow} the required propulsive mass can be obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation with timespan $t$ and solving for $\gls{sym:m}$, which results in equation \ref{eq:propmass}.
%\begin{equation}
%\gls{sym:m}=\frac{Ft}{\gls{sym:Isp}\gls{sym:ge}}
%\label{eq:propmass}
%\end{equation}
%
%By working out equation \ref{eq:propmass} one can see that the required propulsive mass $\gls{sym:m}=$. From this it can be observed that using a control system relying exclusively on rocket control is not reconcilable with the weight requirements imposed on the hypersonic decelerator.
%\subsubsection{Body flaps}
%Body flaps function by introducing a local aerodynamical force by controlling the local geometry. A body flap element produces a lift and drag force as in equation \ref{eq:flaplift} and \ref{eq:flapdrag}.
%\begin{multicols}{2}
%\begin{equation}
%L=\frac{1}{2}\gls{sym:rho}\gls{sym:V}^{2}\gls{sym:CL}\gls{sym:A}
%\label{eq:flaplift}
%\end{equation} \break
%\begin{equation}
%D=\frac{1}{2}\gls{sym:rho}\gls{sym:V}^{2}\gls{sym:CD}\gls{sym:A}
%\label{eq:flapdrag}
%\end{equation}
%\end{multicols}
%Consider figure \ref{fig:flapstuff}. It can be seen that the moment around the \gls{cg} caused by an drag of an element at a distance is equal to 
%\begin{figure}

%	\caption{Definition of flap moment arms}
%	\label{fig:flapstuff}
%\end{figure}
%By noting that both of these forces cause a moment
%\subsubsection{Control system design conclusions}
%From the previous sections one can conclude that all proposed concepts have their own strengths and weaknesses. In order to combine these it has been decided to combine \gls{cg}-shifting with
%
%
%***Moment or dalpha/dt that control systems (cg offset, thrusters, control surfaces) can create***\\
%***Weight estimate of each control system (per concept if needed)***\\
