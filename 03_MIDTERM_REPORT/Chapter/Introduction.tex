\section{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
Before human interplanetary spaceflight can be achieved technological gains have to be made in several fields. One of these fields comprises hypersonic deceleration systems. Significant weight gains are expected to be possible by using inflatable aeroshells. However, the development of a controllable inflatable aeroshell is very complex and consists of many different disciplines. To reduce the complexity of
