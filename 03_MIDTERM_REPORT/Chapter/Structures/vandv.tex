Verification and validation of the mass estimation tools is performed as follows. These activites can be divided primarily into the verification and validation of the mass estimation tool adapted from Samareh \cite{Samareh2011} for stacked toroid, tension cone and trailing \gls{iad} devices on one hand and verification and validation of the mass estimation tool adapted from Anderson \cite{Anderson1969} for isotensoid and trailing \gls{iad} devices on the other hand. 

\subsubsection{Anderson inflatable mass estimation method}
In order to verify the implementation of the mass estimation tool presented by Anderson in Ref. \cite{Anderson1969} the mass estimation tools results were compared to the results presented in Anderson paper. The full estimation model was implemented and consequently checked with the coefficients of the simplified model. Finally the results full model were compared with the results of the merit function for the ballute and the attached isotensoid on page 30 of Ref. \cite{Anderson1969}. No errors were observed in the significant digits. The mass estimates were further verified using the results presented by Clark in Ref. \cite{Clark2009}. The results as presented by Clark were found to be of a similar order. 

Validation of the mass estimation model was presented by Anderson on the basis of reference inflatable structures and is presented together with model. The model within the context is merely a implementation and no additional validation on the model is performed.


\subsubsection{Samareh inflatable mass estimation method}
In order to verify that the mass estimation method described in Ref.\cite{Samareh2011} has been correctly implemented, results for the nine sample cases presented on page 16 of Ref.\cite{Samareh2011} have been checked. These nine sample cases were implemented by choosing the input parameters as given in tabular form (Tables 4 and 5) on page 16 of Ref.\cite{Samareh2011} and the output parameters, primarily component masses and geometric quantities, were compared. A maximum error of 3 $\%$ in terms of total mass was obtained; a maximum error of 2 $\%$ in component masses. These errors are deemed sufficiently small to verify succesful implementation of the mass estimation method.

Validation is performed indirectly: the method \cite{Samareh2011} has been applied in the \gls{edlsa} project \cite{Cianciolo2010}, where it was shown to yield results conforming well to the outcomes of high-fidelity \gls{fea}. The used \gls{fea} is a validated tool \cite{Cianciolo2010} and thereby the method outlined in Ref.\cite{Samareh2011} has been validated through comparison with a high-fidelity validated model. Moreover, the expression for minimum inflation pressure obtained by Samareh has been found to be in correspondence with Yamada et al \cite{Yamada2009}, Clark \cite{Clark2009} and Brown \cite{Brown2009}.

A qualitative check on the results obtained by this mass estimation method is performed by assessing the relations found in section \ref{sec:strucmat} and \ref{sec:strucsens} for their conformance to expectations and other literature on inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The outcomes hereof are reflected by the discussions in these respective sections.
