Materials for inflatable structures are typically high-performance high-temperature-resistant woven fabrics, supplemented by coatings to reduce porosity \cite{Jenkins2001}. These materials are required to be lightweight, strong, heat-resistant and flexible for application in \glspl{hiad} \cite{Samareh2010}. On one hand there are heritage materials, such as Kapton, but for current \gls{hiad} missions these have been replaced by up-and-coming materials, such as Vectran and PBO Zylon \cite{Dillman2012,  Smith2010}. Key driver for the use of these materials is a high specific strength compared to metals (e.g. aluminium) \cite{Samareh2010}. 

An overview of materials, and their key properties, suitable for \gls{hiad} application is given in Table \ref{table:strucmatoverview}.
