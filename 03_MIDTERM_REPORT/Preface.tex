Dear Reader,

This Mid-Term Report is centered around the analysis and selection of a concept that is capable of performing what is impossible with current solutions: to bring a human payload to the surface of Mars with a decelerator mass of less than ten percent of total (re-)entry vehicle mass. This report describes the tool development, verification and validation activities used to analyse the concepts, concept analysis and concept selection on the basis of trade-off criteria. The ultimate goal is to select a concept that delivers the greatest customer satisfaction. Hereafter, the phase of preliminary design is entered and the concept is further worked out to further the efforts of human spaceflight to reach Mars.
%This Mid-Term Report is part of the deliverables for the \acrfull{mtr}. It describes the development, verification and validation of the computational tools produced to analyse several possible concepts for a controllable inflatable aeroshell designed for manned spaceflight. In addition to analysing these concepts a trade-off will be made between them to determine which is the most promising. This concept will then be further analysed in the coming period. The goal of this project is to develop an inflatable aeroshell system that can be used for atmospheric entry on Mars and is lighter than the current solutions to this problem.
