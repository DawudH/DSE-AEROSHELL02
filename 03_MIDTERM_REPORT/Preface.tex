Dear Reader,

This Midterm Report is part of the deliverables for the \acrfull{mtr}. It describes the development, verification and validation of the computational tools produced to analyse several possible concepts for a controllable inflatable aeroshell designed for manned spaceflight. In addition to analysing these concepts a trade-off will be made between them to determine which is the most promising. This concept will then be further analysed in the coming period. The goal of this project is to develop an inflatable aeroshell system that can be used for atmospheric entry on Mars and is lighter than the current solutions to this problem.
