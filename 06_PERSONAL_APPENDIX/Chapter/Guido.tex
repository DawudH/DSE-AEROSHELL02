At the start of this period I began with this DSE, happy to have been assigned my first choice assignment. After the initial project start-up and analysis, I focused on the aerodynamic analysis of the various concepts. Specifically, I focussed the section of code which creates the geometry and discretises it for use by the Newtonian flow solver. Later on, I focused on the design and the optimisation of the aerodynamic shape of the aeroshell.  

I am happy with the way the group worked together and am pleased with the final product. Discussion within the group is productive and generally has participation from the entire group.  I can genuinely say that this has been the best project group I have had the pleasure of working with in my Bachelors studies at the faculty of aerospace engineering. 

The facilities and support provided by the university are generally good. One potential improvement in this area is communication to the students (specifically from the managing DSE staff), as deadlines and methods of delivery are not always clearly specified and conflicting information on various deliverables can be found.
