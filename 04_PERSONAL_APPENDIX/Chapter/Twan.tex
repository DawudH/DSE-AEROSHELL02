My task within the team was twofold. Firstly I was part of the trajectory and control department. Secondly I was validation manager. As member of the trajectory and control department I have worked equal parts with Dawud on the tool. This tool has been the main focus of our work from after the project plan. For the baseline review we have made a numerical simulation for the entire trajectory of the spacecraft. For the mid-term review we have implemented kepler orbits outside the atmosphere in order to make the program faster. We also implemented a basic controller and added the feature of implementing the aerodynamic models into our program.

As a validation manager I was responsible for the validation of the tools that were created by all departments. In this function I have not done a lot before the mid-term review. We do not expect that the workload will increase and thus this task has been omitted.

Next to the actual technical and organisatorial tasks teamwork is a large part of the project. I have the feeling our team works together great, both inside and outside project hours. Everybody feels responibility for the outcome of the project and thus everybody does his very best to get good results.
