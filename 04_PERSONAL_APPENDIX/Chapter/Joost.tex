\section{Joost Meulenbeld}

The first period, before the baseline review, I performed the literature study on control systems and analysed the control system requirements. I also extracted data from the MARS-GRAM2010 software and implemented a interpolation script that provides atmosphere data to the orbit and control software.

In the period between the baseline-review and the mid-term-review, my contributions have been on the aerodynamics software and text. I've written the code that solves the modified Newtonian flow for the given geometry, also outputting relevant plots for all concepts and analysing data. Made another interpolation script that allows for inputting the data in the orbit and control group.

Finally, I was the chairman during the first 5 weeks, leading the meetings with the tutor and coaches, and shaping discussions during the begin- and end-of-day meetings.
