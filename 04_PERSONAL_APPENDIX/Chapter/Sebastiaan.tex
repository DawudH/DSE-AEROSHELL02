\section{Sebastiaan}
For the Project Plan (PP) I made the initial risk assessment. This included determining which elements would be featured in the risk map, deciding on how to structure the labels on the risk map X-axis and Y-axis as well as the technical resource budgeting.

During the Baseline Review part of the Design Synthesis Exercise (DSE) I was part of the group that performed the aerodynamics literature research and tried to determine what methods were suitable to be used to analyse the aerodynamic behaviour of the concepts that were considered. This presented a challenge since for hypersonic flows the non-linear aerodynamics are very difficult to capture accurately without using Computational Fluid Dynamics. In addition to doing a literature survey I made the initial risk assessment.

My main contribution towards the Mid-Term Review was part of the aerodynamic concept analysis. It consisted of deciding on the exact method to be used for the heat flux determination and performing the validation of the modified Newtonian flow and heat flux models. In addition to this I conceived the risk map elements and made the risk map featured in the Mid-Term Review report. Lastly I wrote part of the text pertaining to our approach with respect to sustainable development.

Finally I was of course part of the group meetings and discussions during all of the project sessions. Next to this 

It feels like our DSE-project is focused more on developing computational tools
