\section*{Summary}\label{cha:summary}
Inflatable aeroshell concepts hold the key to what is currently unattainable for interplanetary human spaceflight. In the wake of current \acrfull{nasa} investigations on the feasibility of inflatable decelerators for hypersonic guidable re-entry, this study focuses on Mars entry of a payload mass of at least 9000 [kg] using an inflatable aerodynamic decelerator of at most 1000 [kg]. Such a solution provides a large economical advantage over conventional solutions by maximizing payload-carrying capability through a light-weight device less burdened by launcher size considerations.

This Final Report gives a complete overview of the conceptual and pre-liminary design activities of such a \gls{cia}. To begin with, the over-all mission is described and a concept selection is substantiated. Also, the system is defined, themission risk is analysed and the crew module is designed. This is followed by a sensativity study as well as a performance alaysis in the trajectory, aerodynamics, control, thermal and structural disciplines. Afterwards the design is finalised and recommendations for future work are given.
