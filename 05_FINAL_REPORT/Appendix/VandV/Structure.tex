\subsubsection{Force estimation method}

Verification for the simplified truss model is performed on the basis of simplified load cases. Significant errors were not observed and remained below $3\%$ for various geometries and half cone angles with a minimum of five toroids. The small verification errors followed from the discrete application of the dynamic pressure. Taking the discrete application into account as well the errors disappear.

Validation is performed for the inner root section of the inflatable on the basis of the results presented by Lindell et al. \cite{Lindell2006}. Lindell presents results for the root section of the first \gls{irve} design by means of \gls{fem} analysis and a set of closed-form equations valid at the root of the inflatable. Table \ref{tab:struc_val} presents the results of this validation effort. Errors considering solely the 2D model are significant causing unacceptable results for the basis of structural analysis. These errors can be attributed to the neglection of the three-dimensional effects. 

In the real, three-dimensional, structure lateral loads can be carried in circumferential direction. In the two-dimensional model these loads are however carried through the root section of the inflatable causing steep increases in the loadings of the restraint wrap. This explains the errors as observed in Table \ref{tab:struc_val}. A second model taking into account these three-dimensional effects shows better results. Lateral loads are assumed to be carried in circumferential direction at each of the outside nodes.

The results of Table \ref{tab:struc_val} show that the 3D model provides a decent estimate of the structural loads through the inflatable structure. This is in contrast to the closed form equations as provided by Lindell \cite{Lindell2006}, which allow estimates only at the root of the inflatable. 

It is important to consider that actual local loading may be significantly higher and should be properly accounted for in further detailed design phases. For now this is accounted for by the use of contingency and safety factors. Moreover, it is assumed that the dynamic pressure acts equally distributed over the inflatable surface. This same assumption is used in the FEM validation data. This distribution is, however, only a rough estimation of reality. Figure \ref{fig:struc_pres} shows the predicted pressure distribution over the \gls{hiad} for the final design. It can be noted that the actual aerodynamic pressure is significantly higher at the centre of pressure. The highest pressures are still observed within the rigid part of the centerbody. Local loads are higher and should be accounted for by the use of appropriate safety factors.

\subsubsection{Mass estimation method}

In order to verify that the mass estimation method described in Reference \cite{Samareh2011} has been correctly implemented, results for the nine sample cases presented on page 16 of Reference \cite{Samareh2011} have been checked. These nine sample cases were implemented by choosing the input parameters as given in tabular form (Tables 4 and 5) on page 16 of Reference \cite{Samareh2011} and the output parameters, primarily component masses and geometric quantities, were compared. A maximum error of 3 $\%$ in terms of total mass was obtained; a maximum error of 2 $\%$ in component masses. These errors are deemed sufficiently small to verify successful implementation of the mass estimation method.

Validation is performed indirectly: the method \cite{Samareh2011} has been applied in the \gls{edlsa} project \cite{Cianciolo2010}, where it was shown to yield results conforming well to the outcomes of a high-fidelity \gls{fem}. The used \gls{fem} is a validated tool \cite{Cianciolo2010} and thereby the method outlined in Reference \cite{Samareh2011} has been validated through comparison with a high-fidelity validated model. Moreover, the expression for minimum inflation pressure obtained by Samareh has been found to be in correspondence with Yamada et al \cite{Yamada2009}, Clark \cite{Clark2009} and Brown \cite{Brown2009}.
