Examples with the same ballistic coefficient are presented for each type of IAD, and comparisons are made of minimum inflation pressure, volume, and gas mass. This revision includes corrections suggested by Jamshid A. Samareh of NASA LaRC that have not been made to the AIAA paper of this title.

This paper summarizes the motivation, approach and top-level results from Year 1 of the study, which focused on landing 10–50 mt on Mars, but also included a trade study of the best advanced parachute design for increasing the landed payloads within the EDL architecture of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The EDL-SA Study focused on Exploration-class missions in FY 09, i.e., cargo or crewed missions requiring between 10 and 50 mt of landed payload. Candidate technology areas were assessed against a set of eight EDL-SA Architectures, i.e., representative architectures (high-level designs) against which the benefits of the technology areas were evaluated. The Study used Design Reference Missions (DRMs), Ground Rules \& Assumptions (GR\&As) and Figures of Merit (FOMs) that were approved by the managers of the relevant NASA technology programs in May 2009, prior to the execution of the simulations and the evaluations of the FOMs. In evaluating the FOMs, the Study used simulation-based results whenever possible and subjective assessments otherwise. The major simulation-based result was the Mars Arrival Mass, i.e., the total mass of the payload plus the systems needed for Mars Orbit Insertion and Mars EDL. The key enabling technology areas identified for investment were rigid decelerators, flexible (inflatable) decelerators, supersonic retro-propulsion, precision landing with hazard avoidance, aerocapture, and all-propulsive EDL systems. xiii},

IRVE-3 was a follow-on to 2009’s IRVE-II mission, which demonstrated exo-atmospheric inflation, reentry survivability – without significant heating – and the aerodynamic stability of a HIAD down to subsonic flight conditions. NASA Langley Research Center is leading the development of HIAD technology for use on future interplanetary and Earth reentry missions.},

abstract = {The Terrestrial HIAD Orbital Reentry (THOR) is planned for flight in 2016 as a secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). THOR will launch with its Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) stowed as a small cylinder between the second stage motor and the Antares launch vehicle fairing. Once the Cygnus cargo vehicle has separated from the second stage, THOR will likewise separate, autonomously re-orient itself, perform a de-orbit burn, then inflate the HIAD to a 3.7m diameter cone before atmospheric interface. THOR is a follow-on mission to the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) flight test of 2012. The high energy of orbital reentry will allow THOR to demonstrate the performance of its improved, secondgeneration inflatable structure and flexible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, in a more energetic entry environment than previous suborbital test flights. This paper discusses the sequence of events planned to occur as part of the THOR mission. Specific topics will include the THOR mission concept, reentry vehicle design for the expected flight environment, the on-board sensors that will allow quantification of vehicle performance, and flight data retrieval from a reentry vehicle splashing down in international waters.},

abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that Viking-era entry system technologies are reaching their practical limits and must be succeeded by new methods capable of delivering large payloads (> 10 metric tons) required for human exploration of Mars. One such technology, termed Supersonic Retro-Propulsion, has been proposed as an enabling deceleration technique. However, in order to be considered for future NASA flight projects, this technology will require significant maturation beyond its current state. This paper proposes a roadmap for advancing the component technologies to a point where Supersonic Retro- Propulsion can be reliably used on future Mars missions to land much larger payloads than are currently possible using Viking-based systems. The development roadmap includes technology gates that are achieved through testing and/or analysis, culminating with sub- scale flight tests in Earth atmosphere that demonstrate stable and controlled flight. The component technologies requiring advancement include large engines capable of throttling, computational models for entry vehicle aerodynamic/propulsive force and moment interactions, aerothermodynamic environments modeling, entry vehicle stability and control methods, integrated systems engineering and analyses, and high-fidelity six degree-of- freedom trajectory simulations. Quantifiable metrics are also proposed as a means to gage the technical progress of Supersonic Retro-Propulsion. Finally, an aggressive schedule is proposed for advancing the technology through sub-scale flight tests at Earth by 2016.},

abstract = {There has been limited interest in inflatable deployable space structures since the 1950’s due to their potential for low cost flight hardware, exceptionally high mechanical packaging efficiency, deployment reliability and low weight. A mnnber of significant technology developments focused on the demonstration of such potential include the Goodyear antermas in the early 196O’s, the Echo Balloon series from the late 1950’s to the early 196O’s, the Contraves antennas and sun shades in the late 1970’s to the mid 1980’s and the L’Garde, Inc. inflatable decoys in the 1970’s and mid 1980’s and their space shuttle launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) in May 1996. Results of this work, especially the IAE, have recently attracted user interest. The determination of how well the capability of this new class of space structures can meet the requirements of specific applications is based on a combination of issues that include structural concept maturity, technology data base and the capability for analytical performance simulation. The maturity of the IAE antenna concept and the associated technoloay data base are currently under evaluation for a number of potential missions. Current analytical simulations are addressing membrane reflector shape, reflector error sources, stiffness and thermal stability of rigidized inflatables and potential reflector shapes resulting from changes of boundary condition. Collectively, these hardware demonstration results, the current technology data base and the new analytical tools for projecting orbital performance will enable realistic estimates of the applicability of inflatable space structures for specific applications.},

abstract = {This report addresses issues in developing a flight control design for vehicles operating across a broad flight regime and with highly nonlinear physical descriptions of motion. Specifically it addresses the need for reentry vehicles that could operate through reentry from space to controlled touchdown on Earth. The latter part of controlled descent is achieved by parachute or paraglider - or by all automatic or a human-controlled landing similar to that of the Orbiter. Since this report addresses the specific needs of human-carrying (not necessarily piloted) reentry vehicles, it deals with highly nonlinear equations of motion, and then-generated control systems must be robust across a very wide range of physics. Thus, this report deals almost exclusively with some form of dynamic inversion (DI). Two vital aspects of control theory - noninteracting control laws and the transformation of nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems - are embodied in DI. Though there is no doubt that the mathematical tools and underlying theory are widely available, there are open issues as to the practicality of using DI as the only or primary design approach for reentry articles. This report provides a set of guidelines that can be used to determine the practical usefulness of the technique.},

abstract = {As vehicle masses continue to increase for missions involving atmospheric entry, supersonic deceleration is challenging the qualifications and capabilities of Viking-heritage entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technology. At Mars, high entry masses and insufficient atmospheric density often result in unacceptable parachute deployment and operating conditions, requiring the exploration of alternative approaches to supersonic deceleration. Supersonic retropropulsion, the initiation of a retropropulsion phase while the vehicle is still traveling supersonically, may be an enabling technology for systems with high ballistic coefficients operating in thin atmospheres such as at Mars. The relevance of this technology to the feasibility of Mars EDL has been shown to increase with ballistic coefficient to the point that it is likely required for human Mars exploration. In conjunction with a literature review of supersonic retropropulsion technology as it applies to blunt body entry vehicles, a systems study was performed to assess the impact of supersonic retropropulsion on high mass Mars EDL. This investigation addresses the applicability, limitations, and performance implications of supersonic retropropulsion technology in the context of future human and robotic Mars exploration missions.},

abstract = {NASA has successfully launched numerous science missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system of which the most challenging were to Venus and Jupiter and the knowledge gained from those missions have been invaluable yet incomplete. Future missions will be built on what we have learned from the past missions but they will be more demanding from both the science as well as the mission design and engineering perspectives. The Solar System Exploration Decadal Survey (SSEDS) produced for NASA by the National Research Council identified a broad range of science objectives many of which can only be satisfied with atmospheric entry probes. The SSEDS recommended new probe/lander missions to both Venus and Jupiter. The Pioneer-Venus probe mission was launched in August 1978 and four probes successfully entered the Venusian atmosphere in December 1978. The Galileo mission was launched in October 1989 and one probe successfully entered the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995. The thermal protection system requirements for these two missions were unlike any other planetary probes and required fully dense carbon phenolic for the forebody heat shield. Developing thermal protection systems to accomplish future missions outlined in the Decadal Survey presents a technology challenge since they will be more demanding than these past missions. Unlike Galileo, carbon phenolic may not be an adequate TPS for a future Jupiter multiprobe mission since non-equatorial probes will enter at significantly higher velocity than the Galileo equatorial probe and the entry heating scales approximately with the cube of the entry velocity. At such heating rates the TPS mass fraction for a carbon phenolic heat shield would be prohibitive. A new, robust and efficient TPS is required for such probes. The Giant Planet Facility (GPF), developed and employed during the development of the TPS for the Galileo probe was dismantled after completion of the program. Furthermore, flight data from the Galileo probe suggested that the complex physics associated with the interaction between massive ablation and a severe shock layer radiation environment is not well understood or modeled. The lack of adequate ground test facilities to support the development and qualification of new TPS materials adds additional complexities. The requirements for materials development, ground testing and sophisticated modeling to enable these challenging missions are the focus of this paper.},

abstract = {The suite of Inflatable Re-Entry Vehicle Experiments (IRVE) is designed to further our knowledge and understanding of Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs). Before infusion into a future mission, three challenges need to be addressed: surviving the heat pulse during re-entry, demonstrating system performance at relevant scales, and demonstrating controllability in the atmosphere. IRVE-4 will contribute to a better understanding of controllability by characterizing how a HIAD responds to a set of controlled inputs. The ability to control a HIAD is vital for missions that are g-limited, require precision targeting and guidance for aerocapture or entry, descent, and landing. The IRVE-4 flight test will focus on taking a first look into controlling a HIAD. This paper will give an overview of the IRVE-4 mission including the control response portion of the flight test sequence, and will provide a review of the mission s development.},

The attached isotensoid configuration is shown to be the least mass solution. Aerodynamic analysis shows that a drag performance degradation of up to 40\% for the attached decelerators results when the attachment point is recessed from the forebody of the bus structure. Vehicle integration mechanisms are identified and examined for each decelerator configuration. Using multiattribute decision making techniques, the trailing isotensoid is identified to be the most advantageous decelerator option for use in this application},

@article{Morio2009,
abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a guidance algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the longitudinal guidance law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop longitudinal guidance commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit deceleration profile. Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions. The crossrange is controlled by a series of bank reversals determined by an azimuth error deadband. The robustness and performance of the proposed guidance law are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs with various sets of dispersions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The dimensionless parameters enable scaling of an inflatable concept with geometry parameters (e.g., diameter), environmental conditions (e.g., dynamic pressure), inflation gas properties (e.g., molecular mass), and mass growth allowance. This technique is applicable for attached (e.g., tension cone, hypercone, and stacked toroid) and trailing inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The technique uses simple engineering approximations that were developed by NASA in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as some recent important developments. The NASA Mars Entry and Descent Landing System Analysis (EDL-SA) project used this technique to estimate the masses of the inflatable concepts that were used in the analysis. The EDL-SA results compared well with two independent sets of high-fidelity finite element analyses.},

abstract = {An overview of several important aerodynamics challenges new to the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) entry vehicle are presented. The MSL entry capsule is a 70 degree sphere cone-based on the original Mars Viking entry capsule. Due to payload and landing accuracy requirements, MSL will be flying at the highest lift-to-drag ratio of any capsule sent to Mars (L/D = 0.24). The capsule will also be flying a guided entry, performing bank maneuvers, a first for Mars entry. The system's mechanical design and increased performance requirements require an expansion of the MSL flight envelope beyond those of historical missions. In certain areas, the experience gained by Viking and other recent Mars missions can no longer be claimed as heritage information. New analysis and testing is re1quired to ensure the safe flight of the MSL entry vehicle. The challenge topics include: hypersonic gas chemistry and laminar-versus-turbulent flow effects on trim angle, a general risk assessment of flying at greater angles-of-attack than Viking, quantifying the aerodynamic interactions induced by a new reaction control system and a risk assessment of recontact of a series of masses jettisoned prior to parachute deploy. An overview of the analysis and tests being conducted to understand and reduce risk in each of these areas is presented. The need for proper modeling and implementation of uncertainties for use in trajectory simulation has resulted in a revision of prior models and additional analysis for the MSL entry vehicle. The six degree-of-freedom uncertainty model and new analysis to quantify roll torque dispersions are presented.},

abstract = {Two wind tunnels recently completed at the Ames Laboratory of the NACA—the 10‐ by 14‐in. supersonic wind tunnel and the supersonic free‐flight wind tunnel—are capable of providing test Mach numbers well in excess of 5. Since at this time such facilities are relatively uncommon, this paper is primarily devoted to a description of these wind tunnels and their associated equipment. The treatment of the 10‐ by 14‐in. supersonic wind tunnel is concerned for the most part with the design and operation of the nozzle and diffuser which provides Mach numbers of 3.5 to about 8. Some mention is also made of the pressure measuring and flow visualization equipment. In the case of the supersonic freeflight wind tunnel high test Mach numbers are obtained by firing models at high speed into an oncoming supersonic air stream. Consequently the main emphasis is placed upon the launching techniques, the available range of test conditions, and the methods of obtaining data.},

@inproceedings{Tauber1986,
abstract = {A transatmospheric vehicle (TAV) using airbreathing propulsion requires a long acceleration period within the denser part of the atmosphere to reach orbital speed. The long flight time, coupled with the need for a low-drag configuration, results in severe heating of parts of the vehicle. The ascent peak stagnation point and wing leading edge equilibrium wall temperatures are about 3500 K and 2500 K, respectively, likely requiring some form of mass addition cooling. The corresponding temperatures during entry are 1000 K lower. The vehicle windward centerline temperatures are more moderate, with values peaking around 1300 K during both ascent and entry. Therefore, radiative cooling should be effective over large areas of the vehicle. The windward centerline heat loads during entry are comparable to those for low acceleration ascent trajectories. However, ascent heat loads for the stagnation point and the wing leading edge are about three times higher than those during entry. For comparison, the entry heat load for the TAV's stagnation point is about three times higher than the value for Shuttle. Therefore the ascent heat load at the TAV's stagnation point exceeds the Shuttle's entry value by an order of magnitude.},

@article{Ward1949,
abstract = {By assuming irrotational inviscid flow of a perfect gas moving past slender pointed bodies at supersonic speeds, the limiting values of the aerodynamic force coefficients as the thickness tends to zero are determined for bodies of general cross-section. The expression for the drag coefficient at zero incidence is the same as that for a body of revolution when expressed in terms of the cross-sectional area at any point. The lateral force coefficients and the extra drag coefficient at incidence depend only on the shape of the base section. The general results are applied to the problem of a body of revolution carrying wings of small aspect ratio, and the interference between the body and the wings is determined; this leads to a particularly simple expression for the lift in terms of the lift of the wing alone and that of the body alone which, it is suggested, may apply approximately to any wing system on a body of revolution.},

@article{Warhaut2007,
abstract = {At the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt (Germany) the activities for ground segment development and mission operations preparation for Rosetta started in 1997. Many of the characteristics of this mission were new to ESOC and have therefore required an early effort in identifying all the necessary facilities and functions. The ground segment required entirely new elements to be developed, such as the large deep-space antenna built in New Norcia (Western Australia). The long duration of the journey to the comet, of about 10 years, required an effort in the operations concept definition to reduce the cost of routine monitoring and control. The new approaches adopted for the Rosetta mission include full transfer of on-board software maintenance responsibility to the operations team, and the installation of a fully functioning spacecraft engineering model at ESOC, in support of testing and troubleshooting activities in flight, but also for training of the operations staff. Special measures have also been taken to minimise the ground contact with the spacecraft during cruise, to reduce cost, down to a typical frequency of one contact per week. The problem of maintaining knowledge and expertise in the long flight to comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko is also a major challenge for the Rosetta operations team, which has been tackled early in the mission preparation phase and evolved with the first years of flight experience. \&copy; Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},
