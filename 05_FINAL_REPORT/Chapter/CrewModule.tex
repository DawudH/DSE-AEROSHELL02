\section{Crew module design and sizing}\label{ch:crewmod}
It is essential that the crew module is designed and sized for the following purposes. Firstly, it is a prerequisite to size control mechanisms as the crew module is a dominant contributor to mass moments of inertia by its large mass. Secondly, it allows for the determination of the number of crew members to be taken on board and thereby to investigate advantages of an inflatable aerodynamic decelerator over the conventional rigid solution, such as Orion. Thirdly and most importantly, it is required to yield a full mission description.

To this end, crew module subsystems are designed and sized at a preliminary design level in section \ref{sec:crewsubsys}. Each subsystem is given and accompanied by power, mass and volume budgets. The latter two allow for packaging of the crew module to effect a \gls{cg} location that minimises required control system activity. Crew module subsystem integration is described in section \ref{sec:crewpackaging}. The crew module configuration is carried through to the final design as input for the control system as well as to harmonise a design that integrates crew module and decelerator.
