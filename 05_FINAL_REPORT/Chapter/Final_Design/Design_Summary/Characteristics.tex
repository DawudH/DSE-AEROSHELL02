The mission starts at launch from Earth. A $8820 kg$ crew module carrying two crew members will be injected into a $89$ day high energy transfer orbit to Mars, where it will arrive with a velocity of $7 kms^{-1}$. Before entering the Martian atmosphere, a Nitrogen inflation system will deploy a stacked toroid inflatable heat shield. This heat shield will be supported by ten toroids made out Zylon fibers and will feature a \gls{tps} consisting of a silicon carbide heat barrier protecting a pyrogel insulator. The vehicle will enter the Martian atmosphere twice. The first entry into the atmosphere will decelerate the vehicle to $4.53 kms^{-1}$ to enter an elliptic orbit around Mars. At the apoareion of this orbit, the vehicle will perform an orbit raising burn to place itself in a parking orbit around Mars. Once final landing checks have been completed in orbit, the vehicle will perform a de-orbit burn and enter the atmosphere for landing. During both atmospheric manoeuvres, the vehicle will control its trajectory using bank angle adjustments. These adjustments allow the vehicle to ensure the terminal descent stage starts within $500m$ of its intended location.
