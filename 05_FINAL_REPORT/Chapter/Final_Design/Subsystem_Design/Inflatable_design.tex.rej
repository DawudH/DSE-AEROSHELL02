- Figures \ref{fig:CLCDCSAlpha} through \ref{fig:CGOAlpha} display the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle through an angle of attack range of $0<\alpha<30$. As can be seen from these plots, the behaviour of the lift to drag ratio and the moment coefficient in pitch is near linear. This linearity ensures predictable vehicle behaviour over the entire angle of attack range.
