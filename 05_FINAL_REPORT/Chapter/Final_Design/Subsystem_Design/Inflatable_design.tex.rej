 The inflatable structure consists of three main design elements: The aerodynamic shape, structural arrangement and \gls{tps} design. These elements will be covered in the subsequent sections in the aforementioned order.
-adius of $2.5$ $\left[m\right]$. The cross-sectional offset at the rear of the body is approximately $0.91$ $\left[m\right]$. At an angle of attack of $\gls{sym:alpha} = 22.5 \left[\deg\right]$, it has a lift to drag ratio of $\gls{sym:L}/\gls{sym:D} = 0.35$ and a drag coefficient of $\gls{sym:CD} = 1.3$. At this angle of attack, a \gls{cg} offset of $\gls{sym:CM}\cdot \gls{sym:lref}/\gls{sym:CX} = 0.5$ $\left[m\right]$ is required to trim the vehicle around the pitch axis. It has a moment derivative of $\gls{sym:cm-alpha} = -0.21$.

  Figures \ref{fig:aeroshape.frontview} through \ref{fig:aeroshape.isoview} show the final \gls{oml} of the aeroshell. The final shape is composed of circular cross-sections stacked on top of each other, with an offset in the $z$-direction. The aeroshell is $1.8$ $\left[m\right]$ high and has a maximum offset of $0.9$ $\left[m\right]$.
