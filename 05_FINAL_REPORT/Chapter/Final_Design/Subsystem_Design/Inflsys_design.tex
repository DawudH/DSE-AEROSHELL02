The inflation gas is key to providing the structural stiffness for the inflatable: it is required to bring all members into tension to prevent skin wrinkling under compressive loading. To this end, the aeroshell will require a highly reliable lightweight inflation system that allows aerodynamic deceleration at the start of entry and control operations and is accommodable within mass and volume constraints on the vehicle. This subsection details the selection of an inflation gas and design of the inflation system upon which deceleration capability hinges.
