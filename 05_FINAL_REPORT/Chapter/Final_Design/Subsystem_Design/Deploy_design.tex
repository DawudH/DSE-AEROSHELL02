This subsection presents the design of the deployment mechanism to bring the inflatable from its stowed to its deployed configuration. It is key that this action is performed with maximum reliability, since deceleration of the entry vehicle and thereby mission success hinges on the aerodynamic surface area provided by the inflatable decelerator. This design comprises selection of a \acrfull{hdrm}, a canopy to protect the inflatable during interplanetary transfer and its detachment, and deployment.
