In order to successfully operate the mission during the Earth to Mars transfer and the \gls{edl} phase, several components require electrical power supply and management. Although several primary energy sources exist, photovoltaic energy is already a known and widely used technology. Also, during the interplanitary transfer, sunlight will almost always be available. Therefore, photovoltaic energy will be used as the primary energy source. However,    \\
