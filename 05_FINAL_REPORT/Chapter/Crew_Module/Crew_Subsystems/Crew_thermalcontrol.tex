Where the \acrfull{tps} is used to protect the crew module from excessive heating during re-entry, the \acrfull{tcs} is used to keep other subsystems in the crew module within their operating temperature limits. It is assumed that re-entry phase does not impose extra requirements on the \gls{tcs} as it is completely covered by the \gls{tps}. Note that this only holds when the angle of attack ($\alpha$) is low enough such that the crew module stays out of the wake. Furthermore, the paper used in the mass estimation for the operational items already assigns a mass for the thermal control withiasd
