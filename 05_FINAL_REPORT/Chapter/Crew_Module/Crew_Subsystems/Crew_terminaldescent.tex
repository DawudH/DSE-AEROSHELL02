The terminal descent system, as described in Section \ref{sec:terminal}, consists of the thruster system that decelerates the spacecraft from Mach 5 at 10 [km] height to zero velocity at a height of 0 [km]. The thruster should be placed in the center body and pointed in the forward direction, such that the positive interaction between aerodynamics and the thruster plume is made use of. The total thruster mass, including fuel is estimated to be approximately 1300 [kg], based on extrapolation of .................

The thruster mass is estimated to be 470 [kg], based on a 3g deceleration and using an empirical relation\cite{Christian2006}. This leaves approximately 930 [kg] for the fuel. Assuming the density of the fuel at 1000 [kg/$m^3$]\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket}. Accessed: 11-06-2015} means the required volume for fuel is 0.93 [$m^3$].
