In this section the operational items are sized. This can be summarised as the mass needed by the astronauts to stay alive in the crew module during the mission. For this purpose the paper by Tito et al \cite{tito2013} has been used. In this paper the operational items are called \textcolor{red}{GLS} Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). First the method for estimation is described with its assumptions. Followed by the results of the estimation.

\paragraph{Estimation method}
The mass of the \textcolor{red}{ECLSS (GLS)} is primarily driven by the crew size and mission length. The \textcolor{red}{ECLSS (GLS)} is divided into
