The third phase of the mission is the arrival at Mars and the deceleration to a velocity of $M=5$ at $10 \left[km\right]$ height above the surface of Mars. This deceleration is split into an initial aerocapture, a parking orbit and a final entry and should not take longer than 10 earth days in total. This is the phase of the mission where our design focussed on most. In this phase of the mission the aeroshell is used to decelerate the capsule and protect it against the thermal loads imposed by the deceleration.
%Upon arrival on Mars, first the interplanetary habitat is separated from the entry capsule. The habitat will be put on a trajectory which causes it to burn up in the vicinity of the sun.
The second thing that happens, just before the spacecraft enters the atmosphere, is that the aeroshell is deployed and inflated. %The aeroshell will be continuously kept at pressure during the rest of the mission phase.
The spacecraft is now transformed into a entry vehicle and is ready to start the aerocapture.

The entry vehicle will enter the atmosphere for the first time. This first pass through the atmosphere is called aerocapture. The entry vehicle will fly through the atmoshere following a pre-calculated path using active bank control. A real-time control computer will manage the active control to account for unexpected differences in aerodynamic properties. The goal of this control computer is to keep the kinetic energy that is lost during the aercapture equal to what is pre-calculated. This loss in kinetic energy determines the characteristics of the trajectory which the spacecraft will follow once it leaves the atmosphere. %Diminishing too little energy causes the trajectory to be more eliptic or even hyperbolic. Diminishing too much energy causes the the trajectory to be less eliptic, or it can even cause the entry vehicle to not even go out of the atmosphere anymore. These trajectory characteristics change the orbit period and the fuel fraction needed to change 

After the aerocapture the spacecraft goes into an eliptic kepler orbit. While the spacecraft is on its way to the apocenter of the orbit its attitude gets changed so that the trusters point in the right direction to give the spacecraft a velocity change. In the apocenter the spacecraft gets a velocity change which will get it in an eliptic Mars-synchronous orbit which will not pass through the atmosphere. From this parking orbit the atmosphere can be observed and a plan can be made for the entry into the atmosphere in order to get to the intended landing location.
