A tally was made of all the subsystems included in the spacecraft. First a division can be made by distinguishing between the subsystems pertaining to the crew module and those included in the \gls{hiad}. This division is shown in figure \ref{fig:subsystems}. Also shown in figure \ref{fig:subsystems} are all the subsystems included in the crew module and decelerator.

There exist some links between several of the subsystems.
