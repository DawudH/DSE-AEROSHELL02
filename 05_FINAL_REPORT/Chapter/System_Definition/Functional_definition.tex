The entry vehicle is required to perform the functions listed in the functional breakdown structure of Figure \ref{fig:fbs}, which categorises the main vehicle functions. These functions can subsequently be attributed to the subsystems partaking in the mission.

Sequencing the functions of the functional breakdown structure in time yields the functional flow diagram in Figure \ref{fig:ffd}. Sequencing of sub-functions 3.1-3.2, 4.0-4.5 and 5.0-5.8 is taken up in the respective sections discussing their design. Sub-functions 1.1-1.4, 2.1-1.5 and 6.1-6.3 are performed continuously.
