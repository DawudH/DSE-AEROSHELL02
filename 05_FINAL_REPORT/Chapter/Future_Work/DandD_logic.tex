Key steps to be taken for manned missions to Mars for the proposed design are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Crew module design and decelerator detailed design
\item Ground and unmanned flight testing to further design and component \acrfull{trl}
\item Production and integration
\item Crew preparation and training
\item Establishing infrastructure on Mars
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Future design activities}
The crew module is to be designed. This involves the subsystems defined in Chapter \ref{ch:crewmod}, the crew cabin lay-out and the packaging of the subsystems as outlined in Section \ref{sec:crewpackaging}. Moreover, the decelerator requires further detailed design to fully establish its configuration and ready it for production and integration.

\subsubsection{Production and integration}
Production and integration of the vehicle commences by a definition and analysis of the most cost-effective manufacturing methods and the most reliable and cost-effective joining methods. Hereafter, production and integration proceed in dedicated facilities with a dedicated work crew to take full advantage of crew experience and learning effect. In view of sustainability, non-value-adding activities are to be minimized in conformance with the lean manufacturing principle. 

\subsubsection{Crew preparation}
Crew members are to be trained and prepared for the 89-day journey and ensuing entry, during which they are exposed to high g-loads. Selection, training and preparation of crew members shall include their physical fitness, capability to perform required on-board activities and mental state for their isolatory condition.

\subsubsection{Establishment of a Martian infrastructure}
It is proposed that the entry vehicle is first flown unmanned, in the acceptance testing, to Mars to carry cargo required to establish an infrastructure. In addition, an infrastructure shall be laid out on Mars by previous missions. To this end, the required facilities on Mars are to be inventoried, packaged and sent as cargo on these missions.
