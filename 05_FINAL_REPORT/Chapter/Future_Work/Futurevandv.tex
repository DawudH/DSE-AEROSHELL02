System verification and validation will need to be carried out as the project progresses. An outline of future verification and validation procedures is given in this section. This outline can be used to develop the verification and validation procedures as the project progresses. 

\subsubsection{Requirement Verification}
\label{sec:ReqVer}
Although compliance to all top level requirements has been shown in section \ref{sec:CompMat}, further verification will be needed as the design progresses and higher fidelity analysis have been performed. 

\paragraph{Mission requirements}
The mission requirements can be verified by analysis. A high fidelity model of the re entry must be created. This model will require validated aerodynamic, thermodynamic and inertial properties of the final design. This data can be obtained using a mix of computational models and physical tests. It will also require the control logic that will be used during the re entry to be implemented in the trajectory model. This high fidelity model is then used to demonstrate that the proposed design is capable of fulfilling all mission requirements under all reasonable circumstances. 

\paragraph{Re-entry vehicle requirements}
Re-entry vehicle requirements can be verified by inspection. Design documentation will provide all the relevant dimensions, procedures and masses to be able to prove that all re-entry vehicle requirements are met. Despite this, the total vehicle mass should also be verified using the final product to ensure full compliance to launch constraints. It must also be verified that all COSPAR adherence procedures have actually been followed throughout the production of the vehicle. 

\subsubsection{Product Validation}
Product validation will be performed by physical testing of part scale and full scale models. These tests have already been mentioned in section \ref{sec:TestAct}. The tests relating to the complete, integrated product will be expanded on in this section.
