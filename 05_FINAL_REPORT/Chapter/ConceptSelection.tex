\section{Concept selection}\label{cha:conceptselection}
This chapter describes the steps leading up to the selection of the stacked toroid concept. This concept has been found to yield the most favourable combination of characteristics and was therefore selected for further analysis. Concepts have been generated in a structured way using a design option tree, as described in Section \ref{sec:conceptgen}. Subsequently, concepts were evaluated for four trade-off criteria, defined in Section \ref{sec:conceptcriteria}. This yields an overview of relative concept performance, summarised in Section \ref{sec:conceptperf}.


A more detailed overview of the trade-off process is given in the Mid-Term Report \cite{Balasooriyan2015b}.
