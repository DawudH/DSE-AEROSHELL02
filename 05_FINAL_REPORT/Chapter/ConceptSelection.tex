\section{Concept selection}\label{cha:conceptselection}
This chapter describes the steps leading up to the selection of the stacked toroid configuration. The stacked toroid concept has been found to yield the most favourable combination of characteristics and thereby selected by the customer for further analysis. Concepts have been generated in a structured fashion from a \gls{dot}, as described in section \ref{sec:conceptgen}. Subsequently, concepts were evaluated for four trade-off criteria, defined in section \ref{sec:conceptcriteria}, to yield an overview of relative concept performance, summarized in section \ref{sec:conceptperf}. 

A more detailed overview of the trade-off process is given in the Mid-Term Report \cite{Balasooriyan2015b}.
