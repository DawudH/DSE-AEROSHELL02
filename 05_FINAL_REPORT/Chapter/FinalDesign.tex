\section{Final design}\label{cha:finaldesign}
This chapter will discuss the final design together with the path taken to determine the final design parameters. First Section \ref{sec:iterationprocess} will give an overview of the procedure followed to arrive at the final design. Secondly Section \ref{sec:trajectorydesign} shows the final determined orbital trajectory taken by the \gls{cia}, after which Section \ref{sec:subsystemdesign} will present the design of the subsystems of the \gls{cia}. Lastly Section \ref{sec:designsummary} summarises the design in terms of its performance. In addition to this summary a \gls{rams} analysis is made, followed by an overview of the compliance to the requirements defined earlier.
