\section{Recommendations for future work}\label{cha:futurework}
The mission design requires further design on one hand and testing and design verification and validation on the other hand. To this end, this chapter presents key issues for design improvement in Section \ref{sec:improve}, future work activities in Section \ref{sec:danddlogic} and verification and validation activities are discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:futurevandv}.
