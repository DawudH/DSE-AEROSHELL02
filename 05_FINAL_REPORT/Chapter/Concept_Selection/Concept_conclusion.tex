Concluding from the trade-off criteria performance of the different concepts discussed above, the best concept is chosen that is further developed. The rigid concept is clearly infeasible due to it's estimated mass that is far beyond the mass requirement. The isotensoid performs worst of the remaining 4 concepts, offering a statically unstable spacecraft in combination with poor performance in the lift-to-drag ratio and deceleration performance. The trailing ballute does not perform better than the tension cone and rigid, while still being more complex and a very high development risk. Between the tension cone and stacked toroid, the choice was made to investigate the stacked toroid further, due to its higher \gls{trl} and higher fidelity in determining the aerodynamic shape.
