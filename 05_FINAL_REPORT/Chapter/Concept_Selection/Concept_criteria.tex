Concepts have been evaluated on the basis of the following four criteria: decelerator mass, deceleration time, stability and development risk. These are discussed hereafter.

\subsubsection{Decelerator mass}

\subsubsection{Deceleration time}

\subsubsection{Stability}

\subsubsection{Development risk}
