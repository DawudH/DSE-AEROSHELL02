In terms of decelerator mass, the isotensoid was estimated to be the lightest concept, followed by the stacked toroid, illustrated in Table \ref{tab:cmass}. The tension cone and trailing ballute were notably heavier, primarily due to a higher structural mass. From this mass analysis, mass benefits of inflatable versus rigid concepts were clearly identifiable. On the basis of reference missions and scaling of estimated mechanical and thermal loading, decelerator thermo-structural mass was estimated at nearly 3000 $[kg]$. Key contributor was the backshell weighing well over 1400 $[kg]$. Such a backshell is not needed for the inflatable concepts. This mass was far in excess of the 1000 $[kg]$ limit imposed on maximum decelerator mass.

In terms of deceleration time, lift-to-drag ratio, performance of the rigid concept was best, that of the isotensoid notably worst and those of the other three inflatable concepts in between and comparable. In terms of concept static stability, the isotensoid again performed notably worst, being unstable. The rigid concept proved neutrally stable and the other three inflatables are stable. These results are illustrated by Tables \ref{tab:decel} and \ref{tab:stab}.

Technology readiness, reflected by the \glspl{trl} in Table \ref{tab:gls_rev}, is highest for the conventionally tested and flown rigid concept. The stacked toroid concept was flown in multiple NASA (\gls{irve}) missions and prototypes thereof have thus been tested in a relevant environment. The other three inflatables have received notably less attention, having solely undergone wind tunnel and laboratory testing. In addition, the difficulty of controlling a trailing ballute using conventional methods necessitates the use of morphing. As morphing is a relatively underdeveloped concept and has only been formulated in theory for trailing ballute configurations, the \gls{trl} of the trailing ballute reflects this by being the lowest.
