In this section the methods used for determining appropriate control systems are explained. These systems should be able to keep the spacecraft on the trajectory as defined by the astrodynamics tool in section \ref{subsec:orbittool}. First the assumptions used and their effects on the accuracy of the analysis are explained. Than a point is determined

\paragraph{Assumptions}

**Primary and Secondary assumptions**

\paragraph{Trim point}

**Moment equilibrium figures/equations**
**CG-location plot(s)  with conclusion on CG for AoA~20 and sideslip angle=0**

\paragraph{Stability}

**From E.Mooij**

\paragraph{Available control systems}

**Intro**

\subparagraph{\acrfull{cg} offset}

**Not nessesary for AoA, not feasible for sideslip**

\subparagraph{Thrusters}

**Sebstiaan**
