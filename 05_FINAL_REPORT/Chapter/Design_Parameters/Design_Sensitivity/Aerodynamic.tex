This section will investigate the influence of the shape of the re-entry vehicle on several important design parameters, as well as the sensitivity of these parameters to changes in vehicle shape. It will start by identifying the most important design parameters. This will be followed by a section discussing which shapes will generate a local optimum for a single design parameter. The knowledge of these single parameter optima will be used in the final section to discuss the total set of design parameters for various vehicle shapes. 

\paragraph{Important parameters}
This section will identify the important parameters that depend on the shape of the vehicle and will explain their significance. The following factors were determined to have a significant influence on te performance of the vehicle.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Lift. As detailed in section \ref{subsec:controlsens}!!CHECK REFERENCE!!, the vehicle requires a lift vector to provide flight path control. A larger lift vector provides an increase in flight path control.}
	\item{Drag. The vehicle decelerates purely on atmospheric drag. An increase in drag will decrease the required time for re-entry and provides greater flexibility in terms of the path through the atmosphere. }
	\item{Lift to Drag ratio. The lift to drag ratio of the vehicle is}
\end{itemize}
