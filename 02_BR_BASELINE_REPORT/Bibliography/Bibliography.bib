The flight was a complete success, with the re-entry vehicle separating cleanly from the launcher, inflating as planned, and demonstrating stable flight through reentry and descent while on-board systems telemetered video and flight performance data to the ground.},

abstract = {The Terrestrial HIAD Orbital Reentry (THOR) is planned for flight in 2016 as a secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). THOR will launch with its Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) stowed as a small cylinder between the second stage motor and the Antares launch vehicle fairing. Once the Cygnus cargo vehicle has separated from the second stage, THOR will likewise separate, autonomously re-orient itself, perform a de-orbit burn, then inflate the HIAD to a 3.7m diameter cone before atmospheric interface. THOR is a follow-on mission to the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) flight test of 2012. The high energy of orbital reentry will allow THOR to demonstrate the performance of its improved, secondgeneration inflatable structure and flexible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, in a more energetic entry environment than previous suborbital test flights. This paper discusses the sequence of events planned to occur as part of the THOR mission. Specific topics will include the THOR mission concept, reentry vehicle design for the expected flight environment, the on-board sensors that will allow quantification of vehicle performance, and flight data retrieval from a reentry vehicle splashing down in international waters.},

This paper summarizes the motivation, approach and top-level results from Year 1 of the study, which focused on landing 10–50 mt on Mars, but also included a trade study of the best advanced parachute design for increasing the landed payloads within the EDL architecture of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The EDL-SA Study focused on Exploration-class missions in FY 09, i.e., cargo or crewed missions requiring between 10 and 50 mt of landed payload. Candidate technology areas were assessed against a set of eight EDL-SA Architectures, i.e., representative architectures (high-level designs) against which the benefits of the technology areas were evaluated. The Study used Design Reference Missions (DRMs), Ground Rules \& Assumptions (GR\&As) and Figures of Merit (FOMs) that were approved by the managers of the relevant NASA technology programs in May 2009, prior to the execution of the simulations and the evaluations of the FOMs. In evaluating the FOMs, the Study used simulation-based results whenever possible and subjective assessments otherwise. The major simulation-based result was the Mars Arrival Mass, i.e., the total mass of the payload plus the systems needed for Mars Orbit Insertion and Mars EDL. The key enabling technology areas identified for investment were rigid decelerators, flexible (inflatable) decelerators, supersonic retro-propulsion, precision landing with hazard avoidance, aerocapture, and all-propulsive EDL systems. xiii},

The primary objectives of this flight test were to demonstrate inflation and re-entry survivability, assess the thermal and drag performance of the reentry vehicle, and to collect flight data for refining pre-flight design and analysis tools. Post-flight analysis including trajectory reconstruction outlined in O’Keefe3 demonstrated that the IRVE-II Research Vehicle (RV) met mission objectives but also identified a few anomalies of interest to flight dynamics engineers. Most notable of these anomalies was high normal acceleration during the re-entry pressure pulse. Deflection of the inflatable aeroshell during the pressure pulse was evident in flight video and identified as the likely cause of the anomaly. This paper provides a summary of further post-flight analysis with particular attention to the impact of aeroshell flexibility on flight dynamics and the reconciliation of flight performance with pre-flight models. Independent methods for estimating the magnitude of the deflection of the aeroshell experienced on IRVE-II are discussed. The use of the results to refine models for pre-flight prediction of vehicle performance is then described.},

The lateral force coefficients and the extra drag coefficient at incidence depend only on the shape of the base section. The general results are applied to the problem of a body of revolution carrying wings of small aspect ratio, and the interference between the body and the wings is determined; this leads to a particularly simple expression for the lift in terms of the lift of the wing alone and that of the body alone which, it is suggested, may apply approximately to any wing system on a body of revolution.},

Unfortunately, very few designs made it past an exploratory phase as, among other issues, power consumption was unreasonably high. Recent proposed advancements in technology like the MARIAH hypersonic wind tunnel and the AJAX scramjet engine concepts have led to a new phase of MHD research in the aerospace industry, with many interdisciplinary applications. Compared with propulsion systems and channel flow accelerators, EMFC concepts applied to control surface aerodynamics have not seen the same level of advancement that may eventually produce a device that can be integrated with an aircraft or missile. The purpose of this paper is to review the overall feasibility of the different electric and EMFC concepts. Emphasis is placed on EMFC with high voltage ionization sources and experimental work.},

abstract = {This paper describes a technique for estimating mass for inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The technique uses dimensional analysis to identify a set of dimensionless parameters for inflation pressure, mass of inflation gas, and mass of flexible material. The dimensionless parameters enable scaling of an inflatable concept with geometry parameters (e.g., diameter), environmental conditions (e.g., dynamic pressure), inflation gas properties (e.g., molecular mass), and mass growth allowance. This technique is applicable for attached (e.g., tension cone, hypercone, and stacked toroid) and trailing inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The technique uses simple engineering approximations that were developed by NASA in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as some recent important developments. The NASA Mars Entry and Descent Landing System Analysis (EDL-SA) project used this technique to estimate the masses of the inflatable concepts that were used in the analysis. The EDL-SA results compared well with two independent sets of high-fidelity finite element analyses.},

A mnnber of significant technology developments focused on the demonstration of such potential include the Goodyear antermas in the early 196O’s, the Echo Balloon series from the late 1950’s to the early 196O’s, the Contraves antennas and sun shades in the late 1970’s to the mid 1980’s and the L’Garde, Inc. inflatable decoys in the 1970’s and mid 1980’s and their space shuttle launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) in May 1996. Results of this work, especially the IAE, have recently attracted user interest. The determination of how well the capability of this new class of space structures can meet the requirements of specific applications is based on a combination of issues that include structural concept maturity, technology data base and the capability for analytical performance simulation. The maturity of the IAE antenna concept and the associated technoloay data base are currently under evaluation for a number of potential missions. Current analytical simulations are addressing membrane reflector shape, reflector error sources, stiffness and thermal stability of rigidized inflatables and potential reflector shapes resulting from changes of boundary condition. Collectively, these hardware demonstration results, the current technology data base and the new analytical tools for projecting orbital performance will enable realistic estimates of the applicability of inflatable space structures for specific applications.},

In this paper, a method for estimating minimum inflation pressure is derived for each of three IAD types: tension cone (e.g. hypercone), trailing torus, and double-walled inflatables. Examples with the same ballistic coefficient are presented for each type of IAD, and comparisons are made of minimum inflation pressure, volume, and gas mass. This revision includes corrections suggested by Jamshid A. Samareh of NASA LaRC that have not been made to the AIAA paper of this title. These corrects are related to the double-wall configuration minimum pressure.},
