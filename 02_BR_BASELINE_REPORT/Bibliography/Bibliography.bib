abstract = {The Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment II launched August 17, 2009, from NASA Wallops Flight Facility. The three mission objectives were to demonstrate inflation and re-entry survivability, assess the thermal and drag performance of the reentry vehicle, and to collect flight data for comparison with analysis and design techniques used in vehicle development. The flight was a complete success, with the re-entry vehicle separating cleanly from the launcher, inflating as planned, and demonstrating stable flight through reentry and descent while on-board systems telemetered video and flight performance data to the ground.},

abstract = {The Terrestrial HIAD Orbital Reentry (THOR) is planned for flight in 2016 as a secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). THOR will launch with its Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) stowed as a small cylinder between the second stage motor and the Antares launch vehicle fairing. Once the Cygnus cargo vehicle has separated from the second stage, THOR will likewise separate, autonomously re-orient itself, perform a de-orbit burn, then inflate the HIAD to a 3.7m diameter cone before atmospheric interface. THOR is a follow-on mission to the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) flight test of 2012. The high energy of orbital reentry will allow THOR to demonstrate the performance of its improved, secondgeneration inflatable structure and flexible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, in a more energetic entry environment than previous suborbital test flights. This paper discusses the sequence of events planned to occur as part of the THOR mission. Specific topics will include the THOR mission concept, reentry vehicle design for the expected flight environment, the on-board sensors that will allow quantification of vehicle performance, and flight data retrieval from a reentry vehicle splashing down in international waters.},

abstract = {The lunar surface habitat will serve as the astronauts' home on the moon, providing a pressurized facility for all crew living functions and serving as the primary location for a number of crew work functions. Adequate volume is required for each of these functions in addition to that devoted to housing the habitat systems and crew consumables. The time constraints of the LAT-2 schedule precluded the Habitation Team from conducting a complete "bottoms-up" design of a lunar surface habitation system from which to derive true volumetric requirements. The objective of this analysis was to quickly derive an estimated total pressurized volume and pressurized net habitable volume per crewmember for a lunar surface habitat, using a principled, methodical approach in the absence of a detailed design. Five "heuristic methods" were used: historical spacecraft volumes, human/spacecraft integration standards and design guidance, Earth-based analogs, parametric "sizing" tools, and conceptual point designs. Estimates for total pressurized volume, total habitable volume, and volume per crewmember were derived using these methods. All method were found to provide some basis for volume estimates, but values were highly variable across a wide range, with no obvious convergence of values. Best current assumptions for required crew volume were provided as a range. Results of these analyses and future work are discussed.},

@techreport{Cianciolo2010,
abstract = {NASA senior management commissioned the Entry, Descent and Landing Systems Analysis (EDL- SA) Study in 2008 to identify and roadmap the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) technology investments that the agency needed to make in order to successfully land large payloads at Mars for both robotic and human-scale missions. This paper summarizes the motivation, approach and top-level results from Year 1 of the study, which focused on landing 10–50 mt on Mars, but also included a trade study of the best advanced parachute design for increasing the landed payloads within the EDL architecture of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The EDL-SA Study focused on Exploration-class missions in FY 09, i.e., cargo or crewed missions requiring between 10 and 50 mt of landed payload. Candidate technology areas were assessed against a set of eight EDL-SA Architectures, i.e., representative architectures (high-level designs) against which the benefits of the technology areas were evaluated. The Study used Design Reference Missions (DRMs), Ground Rules \& Assumptions (GR\&As) and Figures of Merit (FOMs) that were approved by the managers of the relevant NASA technology programs in May 2009, prior to the execution of the simulations and the evaluations of the FOMs. In evaluating the FOMs, the Study used simulation-based results whenever possible and subjective assessments otherwise. The major simulation-based result was the Mars Arrival Mass, i.e., the total mass of the payload plus the systems needed for Mars Orbit Insertion and Mars EDL. The key enabling technology areas identified for investment were rigid decelerators, flexible (inflatable) decelerators, supersonic retro-propulsion, precision landing with hazard avoidance, aerocapture, and all-propulsive EDL systems. xiii},

abstract = {Viking-era deployable decelerator technology has been employed for several planetary probe missions at Earth and within other planetary atmospheres.1 2 Numerous system studies in the past fifty years demonstrate the benefit of developing a new decelerator technology capable of operating at higher Mach numbers and higher dynamic pressures than existing decelerators allow. The deployable Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (IAD) is one such technology. This survey paper describes the development history of the IAD from its conception in the 1960’s to the present day. Major findings in primary IAD sub-disciplines for the foremost configurations are discussed. Quantitative engineering data from prior testing is reproduced directly, while qualitative conclusions are referenced in the literature. This work provides a summary of past and present IAD technology development efforts and shows data in a manner useful for today’s mission designers.},

abstract = {The Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment II (IRVE-II) successfully launched from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) on August 17, 2009. The primary objectives of this flight test were to demonstrate inflation and re-entry survivability, assess the thermal and drag performance of the reentry vehicle, and to collect flight data for refining pre-flight design and analysis tools. Post-flight analysis including trajectory reconstruction outlined in O’Keefe3 demonstrated that the IRVE-II Research Vehicle (RV) met mission objectives but also identified a few anomalies of interest to flight dynamics engineers. Most notable of these anomalies was high normal acceleration during the re-entry pressure pulse. Deflection of the inflatable aeroshell during the pressure pulse was evident in flight video and identified as the likely cause of the anomaly. This paper provides a summary of further post-flight analysis with particular attention to the impact of aeroshell flexibility on flight dynamics and the reconciliation of flight performance with pre-flight models. Independent methods for estimating the magnitude of the deflection of the aeroshell experienced on IRVE-II are discussed. The use of the results to refine models for pre-flight prediction of vehicle performance is then described.},
