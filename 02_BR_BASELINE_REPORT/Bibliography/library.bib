abstract = {The Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) launched July 23, 2012, from NASA Wallops Flight Facility and successfully performed its mission, demonstrating both the survivability of a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator in the reentry heating environment and the effect of an offset center of gravity on the aeroshellâ€™s flight L/D. The reentry vehicle separated from the launch vehicle, released and inflated its aeroshell, reoriented for atmospheric entry, and mechanically shifted its center of gravity before reaching atmospheric interface. Performance data from the entire mission was telemetered to the ground for analysis. This paper discusses the IRVE-3 mission scenario, reentry vehicle design, and as-flown performance of the attitude control system in the different phases of the mission.},

@article{Morio2009,
abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a guidance algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the longitudinal guidance law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop longitudinal guidance commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit deceleration profile. Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions. The crossrange is controlled by a series of bank reversals determined by an azimuth error deadband. The robustness and performance of the proposed guidance law are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs with various sets of dispersions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Terrestrial HIAD Orbital Reentry (THOR) is planned for flight in 2016 as a secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). THOR will launch with its Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) stowed as a small cylinder between the second stage motor and the Antares launch vehicle fairing. Once the Cygnus cargo vehicle has separated from the second stage, THOR will likewise separate, autonomously re-orient itself, perform a de-orbit burn, then inflate the HIAD to a 3.7m diameter cone before atmospheric interface. THOR is a follow-on mission to the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) flight test of 2012. The high energy of orbital reentry will allow THOR to demonstrate the performance of its improved, secondgeneration inflatable structure and flexible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, in a more energetic entry environment than previous suborbital test flights. This paper discusses the sequence of events planned to occur as part of the THOR mission. Specific topics will include the THOR mission concept, reentry vehicle design for the expected flight environment, the on-board sensors that will allow quantification of vehicle performance, and flight data retrieval from a reentry vehicle splashing down in international waters.},

@techreport{Ito2002,
abstract = {This report addresses issues in developing a flight control design for vehicles operating across a broad flight regime and with highly nonlinear physical descriptions of motion. Specifically it addresses the need for reentry vehicles that could operate through reentry from space to controlled touchdown on Earth. The latter part of controlled descent is achieved by parachute or paraglider - or by all automatic or a human-controlled landing similar to that of the Orbiter. Since this report addresses the specific needs of human-carrying (not necessarily piloted) reentry vehicles, it deals with highly nonlinear equations of motion, and then-generated control systems must be robust across a very wide range of physics. Thus, this report deals almost exclusively with some form of dynamic inversion (DI). Two vital aspects of control theory - noninteracting control laws and the transformation of nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems - are embodied in DI. Though there is no doubt that the mathematical tools and underlying theory are widely available, there are open issues as to the practicality of using DI as the only or primary design approach for reentry articles. This report provides a set of guidelines that can be used to determine the practical usefulness of the technique.},

@article{Edquist2010,
abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that Viking-era entry system technologies are reaching their practical limits and must be succeeded by new methods capable of delivering large payloads (> 10 metric tons) required for human exploration of Mars. One such technology, termed Supersonic Retro-Propulsion, has been proposed as an enabling deceleration technique. However, in order to be considered for future NASA flight projects, this technology will require significant maturation beyond its current state. This paper proposes a roadmap for advancing the component technologies to a point where Supersonic Retro- Propulsion can be reliably used on future Mars missions to land much larger payloads than are currently possible using Viking-based systems. The development roadmap includes technology gates that are achieved through testing and/or analysis, culminating with sub- scale flight tests in Earth atmosphere that demonstrate stable and controlled flight. The component technologies requiring advancement include large engines capable of throttling, computational models for entry vehicle aerodynamic/propulsive force and moment interactions, aerothermodynamic environments modeling, entry vehicle stability and control methods, integrated systems engineering and analyses, and high-fidelity six degree-of- freedom trajectory simulations. Quantifiable metrics are also proposed as a means to gage the technical progress of Supersonic Retro-Propulsion. Finally, an aggressive schedule is proposed for advancing the technology through sub-scale flight tests at Earth by 2016.},

abstract = {There has been limited interest in inflatable deployable space structures since the 1950â€™s due to their potential for low cost flight hardware, exceptionally high mechanical packaging efficiency, deployment reliability and low weight. A mnnber of significant technology developments focused on the demonstration of such potential include the Goodyear antermas in the early 196Oâ€™s, the Echo Balloon series from the late 1950â€™s to the early 196Oâ€™s, the Contraves antennas and sun shades in the late 1970â€™s to the mid 1980â€™s and the Lâ€™Garde, Inc. inflatable decoys in the 1970â€™s and mid 1980â€™s and their space shuttle launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) in May 1996. Results of this work, especially the IAE, have recently attracted user interest. The determination of how well the capability of this new class of space structures can meet the requirements of specific applications is based on a combination of issues that include structural concept maturity, technology data base and the capability for analytical performance simulation. The maturity of the IAE antenna concept and the associated technoloay data base are currently under evaluation for a number of potential missions. Current analytical simulations are addressing membrane reflector shape, reflector error sources, stiffness and thermal stability of rigidized inflatables and potential reflector shapes resulting from changes of boundary condition. Collectively, these hardware demonstration results, the current technology data base and the new analytical tools for projecting orbital performance will enable realistic estimates of the applicability of inflatable space structures for specific applications.},
