abstract = {As vehicle masses continue to increase for missions involving atmospheric entry, supersonic deceleration is challenging the qualifications and capabilities of Viking-heritage entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technology. At Mars, high entry masses and insufficient atmospheric density often result in unacceptable parachute deployment and operating conditions, requiring the exploration of alternative approaches to supersonic deceleration. Supersonic retropropulsion, the initiation of a retropropulsion phase while the vehicle is still traveling supersonically, may be an enabling technology for systems with high ballistic coefficients operating in thin atmospheres such as at Mars. The relevance of this technology to the feasibility of Mars EDL has been shown to increase with ballistic coefficient to the point that it is likely required for human Mars exploration. In conjunction with a literature review of supersonic retropropulsion technology as it applies to blunt body entry vehicles, a systems study was performed to assess the impact of supersonic retropropulsion on high mass Mars EDL. This investigation addresses the applicability, limitations, and performance implications of supersonic retropropulsion technology in the context of future human and robotic Mars exploration missions.},

@article{Edquist2010,
abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that Viking-era entry system technologies are reaching their practical limits and must be succeeded by new methods capable of delivering large payloads (> 10 metric tons) required for human exploration of Mars. One such technology, termed Supersonic Retro-Propulsion, has been proposed as an enabling deceleration technique. However, in order to be considered for future NASA flight projects, this technology will require significant maturation beyond its current state. This paper proposes a roadmap for advancing the component technologies to a point where Supersonic Retro- Propulsion can be reliably used on future Mars missions to land much larger payloads than are currently possible using Viking-based systems. The development roadmap includes technology gates that are achieved through testing and/or analysis, culminating with sub- scale flight tests in Earth atmosphere that demonstrate stable and controlled flight. The component technologies requiring advancement include large engines capable of throttling, computational models for entry vehicle aerodynamic/propulsive force and moment interactions, aerothermodynamic environments modeling, entry vehicle stability and control methods, integrated systems engineering and analyses, and high-fidelity six degree-of- freedom trajectory simulations. Quantifiable metrics are also proposed as a means to gage the technical progress of Supersonic Retro-Propulsion. Finally, an aggressive schedule is proposed for advancing the technology through sub-scale flight tests at Earth by 2016.},

abstract = {The lunar surface habitat will serve as the astronauts' home on the moon, providing a pressurized facility for all crew living functions and serving as the primary location for a number of crew work functions. Adequate volume is required for each of these functions in addition to that devoted to housing the habitat systems and crew consumables. The time constraints of the LAT-2 schedule precluded the Habitation Team from conducting a complete "bottoms-up" design of a lunar surface habitation system from which to derive true volumetric requirements. The objective of this analysis was to quickly derive an estimated total pressurized volume and pressurized net habitable volume per crewmember for a lunar surface habitat, using a principled, methodical approach in the absence of a detailed design. Five "heuristic methods" were used: historical spacecraft volumes, human/spacecraft integration standards and design guidance, Earth-based analogs, parametric "sizing" tools, and conceptual point designs. Estimates for total pressurized volume, total habitable volume, and volume per crewmember were derived using these methods. All method were found to provide some basis for volume estimates, but values were highly variable across a wide range, with no obvious convergence of values. Best current assumptions for required crew volume were provided as a range. Results of these analyses and future work are discussed.},

abstract = {The Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment II (IRVE-II) successfully launched from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) on August 17, 2009. The primary objectives of this flight test were to demonstrate inflation and re-entry survivability, assess the thermal and drag performance of the reentry vehicle, and to collect flight data for refining pre-flight design and analysis tools. Post-flight analysis including trajectory reconstruction outlined in O Keefe3 demonstrated that the IRVE-II Research Vehicle (RV) met mission objectives but also identified a few anomalies of interest to flight dynamics engineers. Most notable of these anomalies was high normal acceleration during the re-entry pressure pulse. Deflection of the inflatable aeroshell during the pressure pulse was evident in flight video and identified as the likely cause of the anomaly. This paper provides a summary of further post-flight analysis with particular attention to the impact of aeroshell flexibility on flight dynamics and the reconciliation of flight performance with pre-flight models. Independent methods for estimating the magnitude of the deflection of the aeroshell experienced on IRVE-II are discussed. The use of the results to refine models for pre-flight prediction of vehicle performance is then described.},

@article{Morio2009,
abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a guidance algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the longitudinal guidance law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop longitudinal guidance commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit deceleration profile. Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions. The crossrange is controlled by a series of bank reversals determined by an azimuth error deadband. The robustness and performance of the proposed guidance law are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs with various sets of dispersions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This report addresses issues in developing a flight control design for vehicles operating across a broad flight regime and with highly nonlinear physical descriptions of motion. Specifically it addresses the need for reentry vehicles that could operate through reentry from space to controlled touchdown on Earth. The latter part of controlled descent is achieved by parachute or paraglider - or by all automatic or a human-controlled landing similar to that of the Orbiter. Since this report addresses the specific needs of human-carrying (not necessarily piloted) reentry vehicles, it deals with highly nonlinear equations of motion, and then-generated control systems must be robust across a very wide range of physics. Thus, this report deals almost exclusively with some form of dynamic inversion (DI). Two vital aspects of control theory - noninteracting control laws and the transformation of nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems - are embodied in DI. Though there is no doubt that the mathematical tools and underlying theory are widely available, there are open issues as to the practicality of using DI as the only or primary design approach for reentry articles. This report provides a set of guidelines that can be used to determine the practical usefulness of the technique.},

abstract = {Fifty years ago, publications began to discuss the possibilities of electromagnetic flow control (EMFC) to improve aerodynamic performance. This led to an era of research that focused on coupling the fundamentals of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with propulsion, control, and power generation systems. Unfortunately, very few designs made it past an exploratory phase as, among other issues, power consumption was unreasonably high. Recent proposed advancements in technology like the MARIAH hypersonic wind tunnel and the AJAX scramjet engine concepts have led to a new phase of MHD research in the aerospace industry, with many interdisciplinary applications. Compared with propulsion systems and channel flow accelerators, EMFC concepts applied to control surface aerodynamics have not seen the same level of advancement that may eventually produce a device that can be integrated with an aircraft or missile. The purpose of this paper is to review the overall feasibility of the different electric and EMFC concepts.

abstract = {A transatmospheric vehicle (TAV) using airbreathing propulsion requires a long acceleration period within the denser part of the atmosphere to reach orbital speed. The long flight time, coupled with the need for a low-drag configuration, results in severe heating of parts of the vehicle. The ascent peak stagnation point and wing leading edge equilibrium wall temperatures are about 3500 K and 2500 K, respectively, likely requiring some form of mass addition cooling. The corresponding temperatures during entry are 1000 K lower. The vehicle windward centerline temperatures are more moderate, with values peaking around 1300 K during both ascent and entry. Therefore, radiative cooling should be effective over large areas of the vehicle. The windward centerline heat loads during entry are comparable to those for low acceleration ascent trajectories. However, ascent heat loads for the stagnation point and the wing leading edge are about three times higher than those during entry. For comparison, the entry heat load for the TAV's stagnation point is about three times higher than the value for Shuttle. Therefore the ascent heat load at the TAV's stagnation point exceeds the Shuttle's entry value by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {This paper describes a technique for estimating mass for inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The technique uses dimensional analysis to identify a set of dimensionless parameters for inflation pressure, mass of inflation gas, and mass of flexible material. The dimensionless parameters enable scaling of an inflatable concept with geometry parameters (e.g., diameter), environmental conditions (e.g., dynamic pressure), inflation gas properties (e.g., molecular mass), and mass growth allowance. This technique is applicable for attached (e.g., tension cone, hypercone, and stacked toroid) and trailing inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. The technique uses simple engineering approximations that were developed by NASA in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as some recent important developments. The NASA Mars Entry and Descent Landing System Analysis (EDL-SA) project used this technique to estimate the masses of the inflatable concepts that were used in the analysis. The EDL-SA results compared well with two independent sets of high-fidelity finite element analyses.},

abstract = {The Terrestrial HIAD Orbital Reentry (THOR) is planned for flight in 2016 as a secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). THOR will launch with its Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) stowed as a small cylinder between the second stage motor and the Antares launch vehicle fairing. Once the Cygnus cargo vehicle has separated from the second stage, THOR will likewise separate, autonomously re-orient itself, perform a de-orbit burn, then inflate the HIAD to a 3.7m diameter cone before atmospheric interface. THOR is a follow-on mission to the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment 3 (IRVE-3) flight test of 2012. The high energy of orbital reentry will allow THOR to demonstrate the performance of its improved, secondgeneration inflatable structure and flexible thermal protection system (TPS) materials, in a more energetic entry environment than previous suborbital test flights. This paper discusses the sequence of events planned to occur as part of the THOR mission. Specific topics will include the THOR mission concept, reentry vehicle design for the expected flight environment, the on-board sensors that will allow quantification of vehicle performance, and flight data retrieval from a reentry vehicle splashing down in international waters.},

Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (IADs) are a candidate technology that may provide the needed drag augmentation to enable these much heavier missions. The attached isotensoid is one of the IAD configurations favored for application at Mars. Assessing the isotensoid's technical feasibility for Mars missions requires several performance models capable of providing reasonably accurate predictions of key design parameters. This paper describes engineering-level models derived from past isotensoid technology development efforts that have been modified or improved for the problem at hand. Easily implemented models of the isotensoid inflation history, aerothermodynamic environment, and thermostructural performance are described.<sup>1 2</sup>},

abstract = {Fifty years ago, publications began to discuss the possibilities of electromagnetic flow control (EMFC) to improve aerodynamic performance. This led to an era of research that focused on coupling the fundamentals of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with propulsion, control, and power generation systems. Unfortunately, very few designs made it past an exploratory phase as, among other issues, power consumption was unreasonably high. Recent proposed advancements in technology like the MARIAH hypersonic wind tunnel and the AJAX scramjet engine concepts have led to a new phase of MHD research in the aerospace industry, with many interdisciplinary applications. Compared with propulsion systems and channel flow accelerators, EMFC concepts applied to control surface aerodynamics have not seen the same level of advancement that may eventually produce a device that can be integrated with an aircraft or missile. The purpose of this paper is to review the overall feasibility of the different electric and EMFC concepts. Emphasis is placed on EMFC with high voltage ionization sources and experimental work. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a guidance algorithm for the hypersonic phase of a lifting-body vehicle. The guidance strategy is based on a particular kind of nonlinear dynamic inversion, the so-called flatness approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the longitudinal guidance law is in-flight self-adaptive to any feasible hypersonic trajectory and can be written in analytical form with a small set of design parameters. Therefore, the required on-board computational resources are limited, and a reduced off-line design effort is needed for the change of vehicle parameters. Moreover, the closed-loop longitudinal guidance commands are computed on-board in a coupled way without relying on an explicit deceleration profile. Consequently, the approach leads to an efficient management of the degree of freedom associated with the angle-of-attack. PID controllers are then designed based on the longitudinal flat model in order to circumvent uncertainties and parameters dispersions. The crossrange is controlled by a series of bank reversals determined by an azimuth error deadband. The robustness and performance of the proposed guidance law are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs with various sets of dispersions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The reentry vehicle separated from the launch vehicle, released and inflated its aeroshell, reoriented for atmospheric entry, and mechanically shifted its center of gravity before reaching atmospheric interface. Performance data from the entire mission was telemetered to the ground for analysis. This paper discusses the IRVE-3 mission scenario, reentry vehicle design, and as-flown performance of the attitude control system in the different phases of the mission.},

abstract = {The suite of Inflatable Re-Entry Vehicle Experiments (IRVE) is designed to further our knowledge and understanding of Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs). Before infusion into a future mission, three challenges need to be addressed: surviving the heat pulse during re-entry, demonstrating system performance at relevant scales, and demonstrating controllability in the atmosphere. IRVE-4 will contribute to a better understanding of controllability by characterizing how a HIAD responds to a set of controlled inputs. The ability to control a HIAD is vital for missions that are g-limited, require precision targeting and guidance for aerocapture or entry, descent, and landing. The IRVE-4 flight test will focus on taking a first look into controlling a HIAD. This paper will give an overview of the IRVE-4 mission including the control response portion of the flight test sequence, and will provide a review of the mission s development.},

abstract = {NASA senior management commissioned the Entry, Descent and Landing Systems Analysis (EDL- SA) Study in 2008 to identify and roadmap the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) technology investments that the agency needed to make in order to successfully land large payloads at Mars for both robotic and human-scale missions. This paper summarizes the motivation, approach and top-level results from Year 1 of the study, which focused on landing 10–50 mt on Mars, but also included a trade study of the best advanced parachute design for increasing the landed payloads within the EDL architecture of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The EDL-SA Study focused on Exploration-class missions in FY 09, i.e., cargo or crewed missions requiring between 10 and 50 mt of landed payload. Candidate technology areas were assessed against a set of eight EDL-SA Architectures, i.e., representative architectures (high-level designs) against which the benefits of the technology areas were evaluated. The Study used Design Reference Missions (DRMs), Ground Rules \& Assumptions (GR\&As) and Figures of Merit (FOMs) that were approved by the managers of the relevant NASA technology programs in May 2009, prior to the execution of the simulations and the evaluations of the FOMs. In evaluating the FOMs, the Study used simulation-based results whenever possible and subjective assessments otherwise. The major simulation-based result was the Mars Arrival Mass, i.e., the total mass of the payload plus the systems needed for Mars Orbit Insertion and Mars EDL. The key enabling technology areas identified for investment were rigid decelerators, flexible (inflatable) decelerators, supersonic retro-propulsion, precision landing with hazard avoidance, aerocapture, and all-propulsive EDL systems. xiii},

abstract = {This report addresses issues in developing a flight control design for vehicles operating across a broad flight regime and with highly nonlinear physical descriptions of motion. Specifically it addresses the need for reentry vehicles that could operate through reentry from space to controlled touchdown on Earth. The latter part of controlled descent is achieved by parachute or paraglider - or by all automatic or a human-controlled landing similar to that of the Orbiter. Since this report addresses the specific needs of human-carrying (not necessarily piloted) reentry vehicles, it deals with highly nonlinear equations of motion, and then-generated control systems must be robust across a very wide range of physics. Thus, this report deals almost exclusively with some form of dynamic inversion (DI). Two vital aspects of control theory - noninteracting control laws and the transformation of nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems - are embodied in DI. Though there is no doubt that the mathematical tools and underlying theory are widely available, there are open issues as to the practicality of using DI as the only or primary design approach for reentry articles. This report provides a set of guidelines that can be used to determine the practical usefulness of the technique.},

abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that Viking-era entry system technologies are reaching their practical limits and must be succeeded by new methods capable of delivering large payloads (> 10 metric tons) required for human exploration of Mars. One such technology, termed Supersonic Retro-Propulsion, has been proposed as an enabling deceleration technique. However, in order to be considered for future NASA flight projects, this technology will require significant maturation beyond its current state. This paper proposes a roadmap for advancing the component technologies to a point where Supersonic Retro- Propulsion can be reliably used on future Mars missions to land much larger payloads than are currently possible using Viking-based systems. The development roadmap includes technology gates that are achieved through testing and/or analysis, culminating with sub- scale flight tests in Earth atmosphere that demonstrate stable and controlled flight. The component technologies requiring advancement include large engines capable of throttling, computational models for entry vehicle aerodynamic/propulsive force and moment interactions, aerothermodynamic environments modeling, entry vehicle stability and control methods, integrated systems engineering and analyses, and high-fidelity six degree-of- freedom trajectory simulations. Quantifiable metrics are also proposed as a means to gage the technical progress of Supersonic Retro-Propulsion. Finally, an aggressive schedule is proposed for advancing the technology through sub-scale flight tests at Earth by 2016.},

abstract = {A transatmospheric vehicle (TAV) using airbreathing propulsion requires a long acceleration period within the denser part of the atmosphere to reach orbital speed. The long flight time, coupled with the need for a low-drag configuration, results in severe heating of parts of the vehicle. The ascent peak stagnation point and wing leading edge equilibrium wall temperatures are about 3500 K and 2500 K, respectively, likely requiring some form of mass addition cooling. The corresponding temperatures during entry are 1000 K lower. The vehicle windward centerline temperatures are more moderate, with values peaking around 1300 K during both ascent and entry. Therefore, radiative cooling should be effective over large areas of the vehicle. The windward centerline heat loads during entry are comparable to those for low acceleration ascent trajectories. However, ascent heat loads for the stagnation point and the wing leading edge are about three times higher than those during entry. For comparison, the entry heat load for the TAV's stagnation point is about three times higher than the value for Shuttle. Therefore the ascent heat load at the TAV's stagnation point exceeds the Shuttle's entry value by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Fifty years ago, publications began to discuss the possibilities of electromagnetic flow control (EMFC) to improve aerodynamic performance. This led to an era of research that focused on coupling the fundamentals of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with propulsion, control, and power generation systems. Unfortunately, very few designs made it past an exploratory phase as, among other issues, power consumption was unreasonably high. Recent proposed advancements in technology like the MARIAH hypersonic wind tunnel and the AJAX scramjet engine concepts have led to a new phase of MHD research in the aerospace industry, with many interdisciplinary applications. Compared with propulsion systems and channel flow accelerators, EMFC concepts applied to control surface aerodynamics have not seen the same level of advancement that may eventually produce a device that can be integrated with an aircraft or missile. The purpose of this paper is to review the overall feasibility of the different electric and EMFC concepts. Emphasis is placed on EMFC with high voltage ionization sources and experimental work.},

abstract = {There has been limited interest in inflatable deployable space structures since the 1950’s due to their potential for low cost flight hardware, exceptionally high mechanical packaging efficiency, deployment reliability and low weight. A mnnber of significant technology developments focused on the demonstration of such potential include the Goodyear antermas in the early 196O’s, the Echo Balloon series from the late 1950’s to the early 196O’s, the Contraves antennas and sun shades in the late 1970’s to the mid 1980’s and the L’Garde, Inc. inflatable decoys in the 1970’s and mid 1980’s and their space shuttle launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) in May 1996. Results of this work, especially the IAE, have recently attracted user interest. The determination of how well the capability of this new class of space structures can meet the requirements of specific applications is based on a combination of issues that include structural concept maturity, technology data base and the capability for analytical performance simulation. The maturity of the IAE antenna concept and the associated technoloay data base are currently under evaluation for a number of potential missions. Current analytical simulations are addressing membrane reflector shape, reflector error sources, stiffness and thermal stability of rigidized inflatables and potential reflector shapes resulting from changes of boundary condition. Collectively, these hardware demonstration results, the current technology data base and the new analytical tools for projecting orbital performance will enable realistic estimates of the applicability of inflatable space structures for specific applications.},

@inproceedings{Korzun2009,
abstract = {As vehicle masses continue to increase for missions involving atmospheric entry, supersonic deceleration is challenging the qualifications and capabilities of Viking-heritage entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technology. At Mars, high entry masses and insufficient atmospheric density often result in unacceptable parachute deployment and operating conditions, requiring the exploration of alternative approaches to supersonic deceleration. Supersonic retropropulsion, the initiation of a retropropulsion phase while the vehicle is still traveling supersonically, may be an enabling technology for systems with high ballistic coefficients operating in thin atmospheres such as at Mars. The relevance of this technology to the feasibility of Mars EDL has been shown to increase with ballistic coefficient to the point that it is likely required for human Mars exploration. In conjunction with a literature review of supersonic retropropulsion technology as it applies to blunt body entry vehicles, a systems study was performed to assess the impact of supersonic retropropulsion on high mass Mars EDL. This investigation addresses the applicability, limitations, and performance implications of supersonic retropropulsion technology in the context of future human and robotic Mars exploration missions.},
