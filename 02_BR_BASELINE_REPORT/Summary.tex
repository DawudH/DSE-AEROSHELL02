\section*{Summary}\label{cha:summary}

To fulfill the need to carry human payload to Mars one solution is a \acrfull{cia}. The project has to demonstrate the feasibility of such a controllable inflatable aeroshell. The design of this product can be considered as complex. The first steps in simplifying the design process have been summarized in the \acrfull{pp}. The next steps include a literature study to familiarize with the subject. This literature study consists of an analysis on past solutions alongside with the investigation of the primary disciplines involved in the design of a re-entry mission. Then a functional and requirements analysis is performed to generate design options for the different mission aspects of the re-entry vehicle. This baseline report also comprises the market analysis, budget breakdown, risk assessment and an approach with respect to sustainable development. 

\textcolor{red}{Support of conclusions:}

\textcolor{red}{Conclusions and recommendations:}
Future work includes narrowing down the design options to five concepts. In the \acrfull{mtr} these concepts will be reviewed and a trade-off process will help with the selection of the final concept that shall be designed with more detail for the \acrfull{fr}.
