Dear Reader,

This Baseline report is part of the deliverables for the Baseline Review (BR). It reviews the functions and requirements and introduces initial concepts for the design of an inflatable guidable aeroshell suitable for manned space flight. This project follows in the wake of a number of investigations performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on the viability of such a vehicle for entry and re-entry of atmospheres. Key driver for a new solution to (re-)entry using a heatshield is a reduction of mass as compared to conventional solutions, greatly benefiting launch costs for missions to explore and inhabit extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars.
