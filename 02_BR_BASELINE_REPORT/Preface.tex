Dear Reader,

This Baseline report is part of the deliverables for the Baseline Review (BR). It reviews the functions and requirements of the mission and introduces initial concepts for the design of a controllable inflatable aeroshell suitable for manned space flight. This project follows in the wake of a number of investigations performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on the viability of such a vehicle for entry and re-entry of atmospheres. Key driver for a new solution to (re-)entry using a heat shield is a reduction of mass as compared to conventional solutions, greatly benefiting launch costs (or increasing payload capability) for missions to explore and inhabit extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars.
