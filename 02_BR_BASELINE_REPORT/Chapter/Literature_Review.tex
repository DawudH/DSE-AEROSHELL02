\section{Literature Review}\label{cha:litreview}
This chapter provides an overview of findings of literature research on the topic of (re-)entry vehicles. Firstly, past solutions and their development have been investigated for the dual purpose of reference material to be used for preliminary sizing and design and the acquisition of knowledge on mission level. Secondly, each of the primary disciplines involved in the design of a re-entry mission is investigated, namely structural design, \gls{tps}, aerodynamical design, orbital mechanics, atmospheric modelling and control. These disciplines are investigated in terms of their application and new technologies (e.g. the materials typically used for thermal protection) as well as for methods used in their respective analysis and design (e.g. the use of \gls{fem} for structural analysis).

This chapter is structured as follows. The first section gives an overview of past re-entry vehicles; the second section gives an overview of past and ongoing investigations in the use of inflatable aeroshells; subsequent sections focus on the primary distinguishable disciplines involved.
