\section{Risk assessment} 
\label{ch:risk}
This section will cover the initial risk assessment that was carried out during the conceptual design phase. First a risk map was constructed, followed by an explanation of the contingency margins that will be used during the various design phases. These are based on the outcomes of the risk assessment. Section \ref{sec:riskmap} will cover the risk map, after which section \ref{sec:tca} will discuss the technical contingency allocation.

\subsection{Risk map}
\label{sec:riskmap}
 A risk map has been constructed in order to identify which mission and design elements pose the biggest risk. From the risk map it can be seen which elements require the most attention in order to mitigate the risks they pose. The risk map is shown in table \ref{tab:riskmap}. The colors correspond to the amount of risk each table cell represents. The numbers in table \ref{tab:riskmap} correspond to the elements shown in table \ref{tab:riskelements}.

\subsection{Technical contingency management}
\label{sec:tca}
From the risk map of the preceding section one can see that there are many
Several Technical Performance Measures (TPM's) will be used to evaluate the performance of the system at different stages of the design process.
