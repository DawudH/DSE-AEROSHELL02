\section{Risk assessment} 
\label{ch:risk}
This section will cover the initial risk assessment that was carried out during the conceptual design phase. First a risk map was constructed, followed by an explanation of the contingency margins that will be used during the various design phases. These are based on the outcomes of the risk assessment.

\subsection{Risk map}
 A risk map has been constructed in order to identify which mission and design elements pose the biggest risk. From the risk map it can be seen which elements require the most attention in order to mitigate the risks they pose.
