\subsection{Aerodynamic Requirements Discovery} 
\label{sec:aero}
A number of aerodynamic requirements can be seen in figure \ref{fig:RBS}. These will all be discussed here and have been summarized in table \ref{tab:aeroreqs}. 


\begin{table}[h]
	\caption{Overview of Aerodynamic requirements}
	\label{tab:aeroreqs}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.7\textwidth}|}
		\hline
		ID & Description \\
		\hline \hline
		CIA-B01-Aero-01 & The system shall produce a maximum heat flux of no more than TBD [$\frac{W}{cm^{2}}$] \\ \hline
		CIA-B07-Aero-01 & The system shall have a \gls{sym:CD}\gls{sym:A} of TBD $m^{2}$ \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Requirement CIA-B01-Aero-01 follows from the entry velocity of 7 [$\frac{km}{s}$]. Since the heat flux subjected upon a body is proportional to $\gls{sym:V}^{3}$ \cite{Tauber1986} the highest values for the heat flux will be found during the first orbit around Mars. 
Requirement CIA-B07-Aero-01 is caused by the need for a limitation of the maximum allowable decelerations that occur. This can have a significant impact on the mission and mission duration, since this limits the maximum allowable drag force that can be achieved.
