\subsection{Aerodynamic Requirements Discovery} 
\label{sec:aero}
%A number of aerodynamical requirements can be seen in figure \ref{fig:RBS}. These will all be discussed here, together with their origins and impacts.

%\textbf{Decelerate within 10 days}\\
%From the limited amount of time available for the deceleration a minimum 

%\textbf{Decelerate without excessive heating}\\
%In order to guarantee the safety of the astronauts onboard the spacecraft the spacecraft cannot be heated excessively. Since this heat is caused by the drag exerted on the spacecraft this imposes a constraint on the maximum allowable heat flux produced by said drag. 

%\textbf{Decelerate in a controlled manner}\\
%To make sure that the spacecraft is controllable during the deceleration procedure
