\subsection{Thermal Protection Requirements Discovery} \label{sec:therm}
The requirements for the thermal subsystem flow down from the \gls{rdt} and are listed in Table \ref{tab:thermalreq}. The requirements are split up in two parts, the \gls{tps} and the \gls{tcs}. The \gls{tps} mainly distributes the heat load and flux generated by decelerating the re-entry vehicle, whereas the \gls{tcs} controls the temperature of the payload and other subsystems.

    CIA-B01-TPS-01 & The TPS shall be able to withstand the maximum heat flux of \gls{tbd} $ \left[\frac{W}{cm^2}\right] $.               
\\ \hline
    CIA-B01-TPS-02 &  The TPS shall be able to withstand the maximum heat load of \gls{tbd} $ \left[\frac{J}{cm^2}\right] $.                
\\ \hline
    CIA-B01-TCS-01 & The TCS shall keep the payload and other subsystems within a specified temperature range in $\left[^{\circ}C\right]$.

Requirments CIA-B01-TPS-01 follows from the trajectory the re-entry vehicle is following and is bounded by the shortes trajectory, the maximum undershoot trajectory, the vehicle can follow. During this trajectory the vehicle will see the fastest heat developement.

Not only the fastest heat developement is important, but also the duration of deceleration. For the longest trajectory, the maximum overshoot trajectory, energy will be disipated into the shell. The \gls{tps} should be able to coop with this heat developement over time. this need is covered by requirement CIA-B01-TPS-02.

The payload and subsystems are only able to withstand a certain temperature range. To keep the payload and subsystems within this range the TCS follows requirement CIA-B01-TCS-01.
