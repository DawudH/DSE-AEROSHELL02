\subsection{Thermal Protection Requirements Discovery} \label{sec:therm}
The requirements for the thermal subsystem flow down from the \gls{rdt} and are listed in Table \ref{tab:thermalreq}. The requirements are split up in two parts, the \gls{tps} and the \gls{tcs}. The \gls{tps} mainly distributes the heat load and flux generated by decelerating the re-entry vehicle, whereas the \gls{tcs} controls the temperature of the payload and other subsystems.

    CIA-B01-TCS-01 & The TCS shall keep the payload within a temperature range between \gls{tbd} and \gls{tbd} degrees Celcius.
