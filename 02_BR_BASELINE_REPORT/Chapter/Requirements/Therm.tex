\subsection{Thermal Requirements Discovery} \label{sec:therm}
The requirements for the thermal subsystem flow down from the \gls{rdt} and are listed in Table \ref{tab:thermalreq}. The requirements are split up in two parts, the \gls{tps} and the \gls{tcs}. The \gls{tps} mainly distributes the heat load and flux generated by decelerating the re-entry vehicle, whereas the \gls{tcs} controls the temperature of the payload and other subsystems.

   CIA-Func-B03-TPS-01 & The TPS shall be able to withstand the maximum heat flux of \gls{tbd} $ \left[\frac{W}{cm^2}\right] $

    CIA-Func-B03-TPS-02 &  The TPS shall be able to withstand the maximum heat load of \gls{tbd} $ \left[\frac{J}{cm^2}\right] $               
\\ \hline
    CIA-Func-B03-TCS-01 & The TCS shall keep the subsystems within their operative temperature range                                            
\\ \hline
    CIA-Func-B03-TCS-02-crewmodule & The TCS shall keep the crew module within a temperature range of \gls{tbd} and \gls{tbd} $ \left[^{\circ}C\right] $                                        
\\ \hline
    CIA-Func-B03-TCS-03-structure & The TCS shall keep the structure module within a temperature range of \gls{tbd} and \gls{tbd} $ \left[^{\circ}C\right] $

Requirement CIA-B01-03-TPS-01 follows from the trajectory the re-entry vehicle is following and is bounded by the shortest trajectory, the maximum undershoot trajectory, the vehicle can follow. During this trajectory the vehicle will see the fastest heat development. Not only the fastest heat development is important, but also the duration of deceleration. For the longest trajectory, the maximum overshoot trajectory, energy will be dissipated into the shell. The \gls{tps} should be able to cope with this heat development over time. This need is covered by requirement CIA-B01-03-TPS-02. The payload and subsystems are only able to withstand a certain temperature range. To keep the payload and subsystems within this range the TCS follows requirement CIA-B01-03-TCS-01. For now the structure and crew module have been explicitly listed, however it is expected that more subsystems will be added to the requirements further on in the design process.
