\subsection{Control} \label{sec:control}
The control of a vehicle encompasses the dynamics model of the spacecraft, implementing a controller in that model and designing the sensors and actuators on the spacecraft that perform the actual control. This subsection focuses first on dynamics and controller design, then on the implementation in hardware.

\subsubsection{Orbit}
The orbit to allow an aerocapture requires a simulation of the spacecraft through both space and atmosphere. A comprehensive book on this is Computational Orbital Mechanics, \cite{Weiland2004}, while a thesis on an implementation in MATLAB is found in \cite{Leszczynski1998}. In determining the orbit of the satellite, atmospheric properties are very important. A program developed by the NASA named ``Mars-Global Reference Atmospheric Model 2010 (Mars-GRAM 2010 v1.0)" is used to determine the atmospheric properties at all longitudes, latitudes and heights. \cite{Justus2001}

\subsubsection{Flight Dynamics}
The book \cite{Mulder2013} gives an introduction to flight dynamics in general, giving an introduction to stability and controllability of aerospace vehicles. However, it is focused on aircraft. A more in-depth study of stability and control of spacecraft can be found in \cite{Steketee1967, Ito2002}. One of the problems of inflatable structures is the fact that they deform more under loads than rigid structures. The effect of this on the dynamics of the vehicle is given in \cite{Axdahl2009} as well as in \cite{Bose2009}, where particularly this effect on \gls{irve2} is detailed. For a general introduction into control systems engineering, the book \cite{Nise2011} is available.

\subsubsection{Sensing}
An overview of state measurement components can be found in \cite{Wertz2011a}. If no gyrometer can be feasibly implemented, the angular rate can be estimated based on vector measurements \cite{Azor1998}.

\subsubsection{Actuation}
Finally, the actuators will allow the spacecraft to actually follow the prescribed trajectory and orient it such that the appropriate side of the spacecraft is pointed towards the flow. Several typical ways of actuating the orientation vehicle are given in \cite{Wertz2011a}. For hypersonic flows with ionized boundary layers, \gls{mhd} can be used to control the flow and produce a moment. An overview of current state of \gls{mhd} technology can be found in \cite{Braun2009}, prediction of forces can be found in \cite{Kawamura2013}. An overview of retropropulsion for Mars entry is given in \cite{Korzun2009}, which shows a beneficial interaction between retropropulsion and hypersonic deceleration in the atmosphere. Center of gravity offset can be used to control orientation as well: \cite{Petsopoulos1996} uses it to provide roll control on lift-generating vehicles, while \gls{irve3} used it to introduce an angle of attack to generate lift \cite{Dillman2013}.
