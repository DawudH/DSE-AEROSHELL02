\subsection{Structures in (re-)entry vehicles}\label{sec:struc}
Firstly applications and technologies, within the field of structures and materials, as applied in (re-)entry vehicles are investigated, with an emphasis on inflatable aeroshells. Secondly, methods for structural analysis and design are investigated for their effectiveness and feasibility in the project at hand.

\subsubsection{Non-inflatable structures}
Non-inflatable structures have rigid deployment mechanism and are not deployed by deformation. They can however be still deployed by actuation mechanisms. 

\subsubsection{Inflatable structures}
Inflatable structures may be preferable to conventional non-inflatable structures for a number of structural reasons. Most importantly inflatable structure typically have a lower weight. A weight estimation method for multiple types of inflatable deceleration mechanisms is provided by \cite{Samareh2011}.
