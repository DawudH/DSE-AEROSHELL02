\section{Design Option Structuring} \label{ch:design}
This chapter gives an overview of initial design concept selection, focusing on the different missions aspects of XXX. This concept generation is done systematically by means of a \gls{dot} for each of the aspects. Combination of the different trees then yields a number of final concepts. The next phase is eliminating clearly unfeasible or undevelopable concepts. The chapter commences with a \gls{dot} for each of the mission aspects in subsequent sections, including eliminating unfeasible concepts.

%\subsection{Inflation system}
%As mentioned in Chapter \ref{cha:litreview}, inflation can be performed either with (ram-air) or without use of the atmosphere. A third option is the use of both (hybrid), thereby featuring ram-air inlets as well as internal gas storage and feed systems. In terms of the medium used for inflation, conventionally nitrogen gas is used. An alternative would be hydrazine gas, as explained in Chapter \ref{cha:litreview}.
